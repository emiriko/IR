We present in this work in vitro measurements of the force ejecting DNA from
two distinct bacteriophages (T5 and lambda) using the smotic-suppression
technique. Our data are analyzed by revisiting the current theories of DNA
packaging in spherical capsids. In particular we show that a simplified
analytical model based on bending considerations only is able to account
quantitatively for the experimental findings. Physical and biological
consequences are discussed.
