We show explicitly that the sum over punctures for the three times derivative
for the Penner free energy $F_{0}^{3}$, given by D.A. Johnston, Phys.Rev.D 51
(1995) is not correct. As a consequence, Eq.(21), the differentiated version
for the renormalization group (RG) equation, is wrong. Also, his conclusion
that the differentiated version of the (RG) equation for the three-times
derivative of the free energy can be obtained from the higher genus (RG)
equation can not be true. Finally, the differentiated version of the (RG)
equation is extended to any $s$ derivative of the free energy $F_{0}$.
