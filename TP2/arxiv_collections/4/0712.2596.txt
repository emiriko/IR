As a function of the magnetic flux threading the object, the Little-Parks
oscillation in the critical temperature of a large-radius, thin-walled
superconducting ring or hollow cylinder has a period given by $h/2e$, due to
the binding of electrons into Cooper pairs. On the other hand, the
single-electron Aharonov-Bohm oscillation in the resistance or persistent
current for a clean (i.e. ballistic) normal-state system having the same
topological structure has a period given by $h/e$. A basic question is whether
the Little-Parks oscillation changes its character, as the radius of the
superconducting structure becomes smaller, and even comparable to the
zero-temperature coherence length. We supplement the argument that the $h/e$
oscillations should also be exhibited via a microscopic analysis of this
regime, formulated in terms of the Gor'kov approach of BCS theory. We see that
as the radius of the ring becomes smaller, an oscillation of critical
temperature in the period of $h/e$ emerges in addition to the usual
Little-Parks dependence. We argue that in the clean limit there is a
superconductor-normal transition, at nonzero flux, as the ring radius becomes
sufficiently small, and that the transition can be either continuous or
discontinuous, depending on the radius and the external flux. In the dirty
limit, we argue that the transition is rendered continuous, which results in
continuous quantum phase transitions tuned by flux and radius.
