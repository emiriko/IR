The well-known increase of the decoherence rate with the temperature, for a
quantum system coupled to a linear thermal bath, holds no longer for a
different bath dynamics. This is shown by means of a simple classical
non-linear bath, as well as a quantum spin-boson model. The anomalous effect is
due to the temperature dependence of the bath spectral profile. The decoherence
reduction via the temperature increase can be relevant for the design of
quantum computers.
