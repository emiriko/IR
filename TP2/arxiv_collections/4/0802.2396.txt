We study how the charge neutrality affects the phase structure of
three-flavor PNJL model. We point out that, within the conventional PNJL model
at finite density the color neutrality is missing because the Wilson line
serves as an external ``colored'' field coupled to dynamical quarks. In this
paper we heuristically assume that the model may still be applicable. To get
color neutrality one has then to allow non vanishing color chemical potentials.
We study how the quark matter phase diagram in $(T,m_s^2/\mu)$-plane is
affected by imposing neutrality and by including the Polyakov loop dynamics.
Although these two effects are correlated in a nonlinear way, the impact of the
Polyakov loop turns out to be significant in the $T$ direction, while imposing
neutrality brings a remarkable effect in the $m_s^2/\mu$ direction. In
particular, we find a novel unlocking transition, when the temperature is
increased, even in the chiral SU(3) limit. We clarify how and why this is
possible once the dynamics of the colored Polyakov loop is taken into account.
Also we succeed in giving an analytic expression for $T_c$ for the transition
from two-flavor pairing (2SC) to unpaired quark matter in the presence of the
Polyakov loop.
