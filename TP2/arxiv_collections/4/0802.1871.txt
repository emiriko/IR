The author suggests a low cost special AB-Net from artificial fiber, which
may protect cities and important objects from rockets, artillery and mortar
shells, projectiles, bullets, and strategic weapons. The idea is as follows:
The offered AB-Net joins an incoming projectile to a small braking parachute
and this incoming projectile loses speed by air braking after a drag distance
of 50 - 150 meters. A following interception net after the first may serve to
collect the slowed projectiles and their fragments or bomblets so that they do
not reach the aimpoint. The author offers the design of AB-Net, a developed
theory of snagging with a small braking parachute by AB-Net; and sample
computations. These nets may be used for defense of a town, city, military
base, battle-front line, road (from terrorists), or any important objects or
installations (for example nuclear electric station, government buildings,
etc.). Computed projects are: Net to counter small rockets (for example, from
Qassam), net to counter artillery projectile (caliber 76 mm), net to counter
bullets (caliber 7.6 mm).
  The offered method is cheaper by thousands of times than protection of a city
by current anti-rocket systems. Discussion and results are at the end of the
article.
