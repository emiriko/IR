We perform rescaled range analysis upon the signals measured by Dual Particle
Dynamical Analyzer in gas-liquid two-phase turbulent jets. A novel rescaled
range analysis is proposed to investigate these unevenly sampled signals. The
Hurst exponents of velocity and other passive scalars in the bulk of spray are
obtained to be 0.59$\pm $0.02 and the fractal dimension is hence 1.41$\pm $
0.02, which are in remarkable agreement with and much more precise than
previous results. These scaling exponents are found to be independent of the
configuration and dimensions of the nozzle and the fluid flows. Therefore, such
type of systems form a universality class with invariant scaling properties.
