The aim of this paper is to determine the expectations that French-speaking
disabled persons have for electronic administrative sites (utility). At the
same time, it is a matter of identifying the difficulties of use that the
manipulation of these E-services poses concretely for blind people (usability)
and of evaluating the psychosocial impacts on the way of life of these people
with specific needs. We show that the lack of numerical accessibility is likely
to accentuate the social exclusion of which these people are victim by
establishing a numerical glass ceiling.
