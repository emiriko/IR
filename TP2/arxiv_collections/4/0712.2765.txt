In our recent paper (Phys. Rev. B 76, 075403 (2007)), we have applied the
anyon concept to derive an approximate analytic formula for the ground state
energy, which applies to two-dimensional (2D) Coulomb systems from the bosonic
to the fermionic limit. We make use of these results here to draw attention to
correlation effects for two special cases: the spin-polarized 2D fermion system
and the charged anyon system close to the bosonic limit. By comparison with
quantum Monte-Carlo data (for the former) and exact results obtained in the
hypernetted-chain and Bogolyubov approximations (for the latter) we can
conclude on correlation effects, which have their origin in the bosonic systems
and come into play by using the anyon concept. To our knowledge, these
correlations are not yet considered in the literature.
