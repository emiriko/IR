Free initial data for general relativity on a pair of intersecting null
hypersurfaces are well known, but the lack of a Poisson bracket and concerns
about caustics have stymied the development of a constraint free canonical
theory. Here it is pointed out how caustics and generator crossings can be
neatly avoided and a Poisson bracket on free data is given. On sufficiently
regular functions of the solution spacetime geometry this bracket matches the
Poisson bracket defined on such functions by the Hilbert action via Peierls'
prescription. The symplectic form is also given in terms of free data.
