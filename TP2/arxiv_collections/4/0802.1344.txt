We consider transport in the insulating regime of GaMnAs. We calculate the
resistance, magnetoresitance and Hall effect, assuming that the Fermi energy is
in the region of localized states above the valence band mobility edge. Both
hopping and activated band transport contributions are included. The anomalous
Hall current from band states is very different from the hopping Hall current
and has extrinsic (skew) and intrinsic (Luttinger) contributions. Comparison
with experiment allows us to assess the degree to which band and hopping
contribution determine each of the three transport coefficients in a particular
temperature range. There are strong indications that the insulating state
transport in GaMnAs is controlled primarily by extended state, band edge,
transport rather than by variable range hopping, as reported in the literature.
