The $K^-pp$ system is investigated using a variational approach with
realistic two-body interactions: the Argonne v18 $NN$ potential and an energy
dependent $\bar{K}N$ effective interaction derived from chiral SU(3)
coupled-channel dynamics. Uncertainties in subthreshold extrapolations of the
$\bar{K}N$ interaction are considered. A weakly bound $K^-pp$ state is found,
with a binding energy $B = (19\pm 3)$ MeV substantially smaller than suggested
in previous calculations. The decay width $\Gamma(K^-pp\to \pi\Sigma N)$ is
estimated to range between about 40 and 70 MeV.
