Charge detection utilizing a highly biased quantum point contact has become
the most effective probe for studying few electron quantum dot circuits.
Measurements on double and triple quantum dot circuits is performed to clarify
a back action role of charge sensing on the confined electrons. The quantum
point contact triggers inelastic transitions, which occur quite generally.
Under specific device and measurement conditions these transitions manifest
themselves as bounded regimes of telegraph noise within a stability diagram. A
nonequilibrium transition from artificial atomic to molecular behavior is
identified. Consequences for quantum information applications are discussed.
