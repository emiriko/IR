In this decade, there are huge efforts to explore B-meson decays, which offer
interesting probes to test the quark-flavour structure of the Standard Model
and to search for signals of new physics. Exciting new perspectives for these
studies will soon arise at the LHC, where decays of $B^0_s$ mesons will be a
key target of the B-physics programme. We will discuss theoretical aspects of
various benchmark channels and address the question of how much space for
new-physics effects in their observables is left by the recent experimental
results from the B factories and the Tevatron.
