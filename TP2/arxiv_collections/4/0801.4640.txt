We study the scalar Higgs sector of the next-to-minimal supersymmetric
standard model with an extra U(1), which has two Higgs doublets and a Higgs
singlet, in the light leptophobic $Z'$ scenario where the extra neutral gauge
boson $Z'$ does not couple to charged leptons. In this model, we find that the
sum of the squared coupling coefficients of the three neutral scalar Higgs
bosons to $ZZ$, normalized by the corresponding SM coupling coefficient is
noticeably smaller than unity, due to the effect of the extra U(1), for a
reasonable parameter space of the model, whereas it is unity in the
next-to-minimal supersymmetric standard model. Thus, these two models may be
distinguished if the coupling coefficients of neutral scalar Higgs bosons to
$ZZ$ are measured at the future International Linear Collider by producing them
via the Higgs-strahlung, $ZZ$ fusion, and $WW$ fusion processes.
