A simple technique for robust generation of vibrational Fock states in a
chain of trapped ions is proposed. The method is fast and easy to implement,
since only a single chirped laser pulse, simultaneously addressing all of the
ions, is required. Furthermore, because the approach uses collective adiabatic
passage, significant fluctuations in the intensity or frequency of the laser
pulse can be tolerated, and the technique performs well even on the border of
the Lamb-Dicke regime. We also demonstrate how this technique may be extended
in order to create non-classical superposition states of the ions' collective
motion and Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states of their internal states. Because
only a single laser pulse is required, heating effects arising under realistic
experimental conditions are negligibly small.
