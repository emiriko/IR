The single-copy entanglement of a given many-body system is defined [J.
Eisert and M. Cramer, Phys. Rev. A. 72, 042112 (2005)] as the maximal
entanglement deterministically distillable from a bipartition of a single
specimen of that system. For critical (gapless) spin chains, it was recently
shown that this is exactly half the von Neumann entropy [R. Orus, J. I.
Latorre, J. Eisert, and M. Cramer, Phys. Rev. A 73, 060303(R) (2006)], itself
defined as the entanglement distillable in the asymptotic limit: i.e. given an
infinite number of copies of the system. It is an open question as to what the
equivalent behaviour for gapped systems is. In this paper, I show that for the
paradigmatic spin-S Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki chain (the archetypal gapped
chain), the single-copy entanglement is equal to the von Neumann entropy: i.e.
all the entanglement present may be distilled from a single specimen.
