Angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy study is reported on a high quality
optimally doped Bi2Sr1.6La0.4CuO6+delta high Tc superconductor. In the
antinodal region with maximal d-wave gap, the symbolic superconducting
coherence peak, which has been widely observed in multi-CuO2-layer cuprate
superconductors, is unambiguously observed in a single layer system. The
associated peak-dip separation is just about 19 meV, which is much smaller than
its counterparts in multi-layered compounds, but correlates with the energy
scales of spin excitations in single layer cuprates.
