Recent work has shown that neutrino oscillations in matter can be greatly
enhanced by flips between mass eigenstates if the medium is fluctuating with a
period equal to the neutrino oscillation length. Here we investigate the effect
of the primordial fluctuations on the neutrino oscillations in the early
universe. We calculate the oscillation probability in the case of a general
power law fluctuation spectrum and for a more realistic spectrum predicted by
inflation. We also include the effect of the amplification of fluctuations
resulting from the QCD phase transition. We find that there is a region of
parameter space where this mechanism would be the dominant mechanism for
producing sterile neutrinos. However this conclusion does not take account of
the damping of fluctuations on the neutrino oscillation scale when the
neutrinos decouple from the plasma. We find that this reduces the probability
of flips between the mass eigenstates to an unobservable level.
