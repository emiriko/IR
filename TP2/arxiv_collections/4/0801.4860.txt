We study the effect of adaptivity on a social model of opinion dynamics and
consensus formation. We analyze how the adaptivity of the network of contacts
between agents to the underlying social dynamics affects the size and
topological properties of groups and the convergence time to the stable final
state. We find that, while on static networks these properties are determined
by percolation phenomena, on adaptive networks the rewiring process leads to
different behaviors: Adaptive rewiring fosters group formation by enhancing
communication between agents of similar opinion, though it also makes possible
the division of clusters. We show how the convergence time is determined by the
characteristic time of link rearrangement. We finally investigate how the
adaptivity yields nontrivial correlations between the internal topology and the
size of the groups of agreeing agents.
