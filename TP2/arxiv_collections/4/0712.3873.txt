We explicitly determine the elliptic K3 surfaces with a maximal singular
fibre. If the characteristic of the ground field is different from 2, for each
of the two possible maximal fibre types, $I_{19}$ and $I^*_{14}$, the surface
is unique. In characteristic 2 the maximal fibre types are $I_{18}$ and
$I^*_{13}$, and there exist two (resp. one) one-parameter families of such
surfaces.
