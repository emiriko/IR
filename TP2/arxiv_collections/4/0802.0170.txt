The overlap operator is just the simplest of a class of Dirac operators with
an exact chiral symmetry. I demonstrate how a general class of chiral Dirac
operators can be constructed, show that they have no fermion doublers and that
they are all exponentially local, and test my conclusions numerically for a few
examples. However, since these operators are more expensive than the overlap
operator, it is unlikely that they will be useful in practical simulations.
