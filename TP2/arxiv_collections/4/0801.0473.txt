Semileptonic $B$($B_s, B_c$) decays are investigated systematically in the
light-cone QCD sum rules. Special emphasis is put on the LCSR calculation on
weak form factors with an adequate chiral current correlator, which turns out
to be particularly effective to control the pollution by higher twist
components of spectator mesons. The result for each channel depends on the
distribution amplitude of the the producing meson. The leading twist
distribution amplitudes of the related heavy mesons and charmonium are worked
out by a model approach in the reasonable way. A practical scenario is
suggested to understand the behavior of weak form factors in the whole
kinematically accessible ranges. The decay widths and branching ratios are
estimated for several $B$($B_c$) decay modes of current interest.
