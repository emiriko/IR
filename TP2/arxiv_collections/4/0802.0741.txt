We construct new supersymmetric multi-black ring solutions on the
Eguchi-Hanson base space as solutions of the five-dimensional minimal
supergravity. The space-time has an asymptotically locally Euclidean time
slice, i.e., it has the spatial infinity with the topology of the lens space
$L(2;1)=S^3/Z_2$. The configurations of black rings are restricted by the
requirement of the absence of a Dirac-Misner string everywhere outside
horizons. Especially, in the case of two black rings, the solutions have the
limit to a pair of rotating black holes with the horizon topology of S^3.
