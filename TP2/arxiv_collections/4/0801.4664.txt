Codes have been used for centuries to convey secret information.To a
cryptanalyst, the interception of a code is only the first step in recovering a
secret message.Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a biological and molecular
code.Through the work of Marshall Nirenberg and others, DNA is now understood
to specify for amino acids in triplet codes of bases.The possibilty of DNA
encoding secret information in a natural language is explored, since a code is
expected to have a distinct mathematical solution.
