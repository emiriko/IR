This thesis is concerned with a realisation of topological theories in terms
of statistical models known as Calabi-Yau crystals. The thesis starts with an
introduction and review of topological field and string theories. Subsequently
several new results are presented. The main focus of the thesis is on the
topological string theory. In this case crystal models correspond to
three-dimensional partitions and their relations with the topological vertex
theory and knot invariants are studied. Two-dimensional crystal models
corresponding to topological gauge theories on ALE spaces are also introduced
and analysed. Essential mathematical tools are summarised in appendices.
