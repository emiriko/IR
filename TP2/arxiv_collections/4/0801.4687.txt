We study experimentally and numerically the nonlinear scattering of wave
packets by local multi-site guiding centers embedded in a continuous dielectric
medium, as a function of the input power and angle of incidence. The extent of
trapping into the linear modes of different sites is manipulated as a function
of both the input power and incidence angle, demonstrating power-controlled
switching of nonlinear trapping by local photonic potentials.
