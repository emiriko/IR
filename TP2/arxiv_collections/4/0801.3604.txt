It is shown that spectrally resolved photon-statistics measurements of the
resonance fluorescence from realistic semiconductor quantum-dot systems allow
for high contrast identification of the two-photon strong-coupling states.
Using a microscopic theory, the second-rung resonance is analyzed and optimum
excitation conditions are determined. The computed photon-statistics spectrum
displays gigantic, experimentally robust resonances at the energetic positions
of the second-rung emission.
