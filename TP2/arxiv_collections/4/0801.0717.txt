Recently we have shown that the reduction of the Carruthers-Nieto symmetric
quantum phase fluctuation parameter (U) with respect to its coherent state
value corresponds to an antibunched state, but the converse is not true.
Consequently reduction of U is a stronger criterion of nonclassicality than the
lowest order antibunching. Here we have studied the possibilities of reduction
of $U$ in intermediate states by using the Barnett Pegg formalism. We have
shown that the reduction of phase fluctuation parameter U can be seen in
different intermediate states, such as binomial state, generalized binomial
state, hypergeometric state, negative binomial state, and photon added coherent
state. It is also shown that the depth of nonclassicality can be controlled by
various parameters related to intermediate states. Further, we have provided
specific examples of antibunched states, for which $U$ is greater than its
poissonian state value.
