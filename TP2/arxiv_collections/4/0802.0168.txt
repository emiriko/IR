We investigate enhanced EW corrections to inclusive hard processes in the TeV
energy region with emphasis on the small-x situation, in which the hard scale Q
is significantly smaller than the available energy \sqrt{s}= Q/x. We first
propose and justify a general factorization formula in which the (double-log)
EW form factor at scale Q^2 is factorized from EW parton distribution
functions, which satisfy evolution equations of DGLAP type. We then investigate
the small-x behavior of the EW parton distributions including the novel ones
for non-vanishing t-channel weak isospin T and we compare it with a BFKL-type
approach. In either approach we find that large small-x corrections of order
\alpha_w \log x \log Q^2/M^2 (M being the EW symmetry breaking scale) are
present only for T=2 and not for T=1. This implies that only transverse WW
interactions (coupled to T=2) are affected, while the T=1 components feel just
the form factor at scale Q^2.
