We study the Fareytail expansion of the topological partition function of N=4
SU(N) super Yang-Mills theory on K3. We argue that this expansion corresponds
to a sum over geometries in asymptotically AdS_3 spacetime, which is
holographically dual to a large number of coincident fundamental heterotic
strings.
