We study the competition between the nematic and the hexatic phases of a
two-dimensional spinless Fermi fluid near Pomeranchuk instabilities. We show
that the general phase diagram of this theory contains a bicritical point where
two second order lines and a first order nematic/hexatic phase transition meet
together. We found that at criticality, and deep inside the associated symmetry
broken phases, the low energy theory is governed by a dissipative cubic mode,
even near the bicritical point where nematic and hexatic fluctuations cannot be
distinguished due to very strong dynamical couplings.
