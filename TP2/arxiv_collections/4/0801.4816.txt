When the surface of a first material is brought into contact with the surface
of a second material the contact region is called an interface. Since the time
of James Clerk Maxwell it has been customary to treat a material electrically
as having well-defined bulk properties and having surfaces of zero-thickness.
In order to obtain a better understanding of the interface this paper reviews
Maxwell's original argument to justify a zero-thickness-surface and reexamines
the interface problem assuming electrical charges are actually particles having
a finite thickness. Thermodynamics requires that in thermal equilibrium any
movement of free charge cannot produce a net electrical current anywhere in the
materials or across their interface. For materials in contact and in thermal
equilibrium this reexamination gives a set of equations that can be called the
interfacial electro-thermal equilibrium (IETE) criteria. A well-defined
interfacial potential results from this criteria.
