Data on functional disability are of widespread policy interest in the United
States, especially with respect to planning for Medicare and Social Security
for a growing population of elderly adults. We consider an extract of
functional disability data from the National Long Term Care Survey (NLTCS) and
attempt to develop disability profiles using variations of the Grade of
Membership (GoM) model. We first describe GoM as an individual-level mixture
model that allows individuals to have partial membership in several mixture
components simultaneously. We then prove the equivalence between
individual-level and population-level mixture models, and use this property to
develop a Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm for Bayesian estimation of the
model. We use our approach to analyze functional disability data from the
NLTCS.
