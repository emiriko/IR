We study the dynamics of the quantum optical spring, i.e., a spring whose
spring constant undergoes discreet jumps depending on the quantum state of
another system. We show the existence of revivals and fractional revivals in
the quantum dynamics reminiscent of similar dynamical features in cavity QED.
We recover in the semi classical limit the results for an oscillator whose
frequency undergoes a sudden change. The quantum optical spring is conceivable
for example by a micromirror under the influence of radiation pressure by a
field which is strictly quantum. Our work suggests that driven systems would in
general exhibit a very different dynamics if the drive is replaced by a quantum
source.
