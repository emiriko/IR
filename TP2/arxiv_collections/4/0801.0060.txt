The high speed of light in vacuo together with the weakness of Earth gravity
rules out any experimental detection of gravitational deflection of light on
the laboratory length scale. Recent advances in coherent optics that produce
ultra slow light in highly dispersive media with the group velocities down to
~102 ms-1, or even less, however, open up this possibility. In this work, we
present a theoretical study for a possible laboratory observation of the
deflection of such an ultra slow light in the highly dispersive medium under
Earth gravity. Our general relativistic calculation is based on the Gordon
optical metric modified so as to include dispersion. The calculated linear
vertical deflection turns out to be ~0.1 mm for a horizontal traversal of 0.1
m, and a group speed vg ~ 102 ms-1. Experimental realizability and some
conceptual points involved will be briefly discussed.
