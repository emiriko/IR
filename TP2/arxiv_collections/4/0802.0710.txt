We present an analytic result for the 1-loop quantum mass correction in
semiclassical quantization for the twisted \phi^4 kink on S^1 without explicit
knowledge of the fluctuation spectrum. For this purpose we use the contour
integral representation of the spectral zeta function. By solving the Bethe
ansatz equations for the n=2 Lame equation we obtain an analytic expression for
the corresponding spectral discriminant. We discuss the renormalization issues
of this model. An energetically preferred size for the compact space is finally
obtained.
