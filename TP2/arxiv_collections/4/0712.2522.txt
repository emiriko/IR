We introduce a systematic formalism for two-resonator circuit QED, where two
on-chip microwave resonators are simultaneously coupled to one superconducting
qubit. Within this framework, we demonstrate that the qubit can function as a
quantum switch between the two resonators, which are assumed to be originally
independent. In this three-circuit network, the qubit mediates a geometric
second-order circuit interaction between the otherwise decoupled resonators. In
the dispersive regime, it also gives rise to a dynamic second-order
perturbative interaction. The geometric and dynamic coupling strengths can be
tuned to be equal, thus permitting to switch on and off the interaction between
the two resonators via a qubit population inversion or a shifting of the qubit
operation point. We also show that our quantum switch represents a flexible
architecture for the manipulation and generation of nonclassical microwave
field states as well as the creation of controlled multipartite entanglement in
circuit QED. In addition, we clarify the role played by the geometric
interaction, which constitutes a fundamental property characteristic of
superconducting quantum circuits without counterpart in quantum-optical
systems. We develop a detailed theory of the geometric second-order coupling by
means of circuit transformations for superconducting charge and flux qubits.
Furthermore, we show the robustness of the quantum switch operation with
respect to decoherence mechanisms. Finally, we propose a realistic design for a
two-resonator circuit QED setup based on a flux qubit and estimate all the
related parameters. In this manner, we show that this setup can be used to
implement a superconducting quantum switch with available technology.
