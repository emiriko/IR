The gravitational collapse of a wide class of self-interacting homogeneous
scalar fields models is analyzed. The class is characterized by certain general
conditions on the scalar field potential, which, in particular, include both
asymptotically polynomial and exponential behaviors. Within this class, we show
that the generic evolution is always divergent in a finite time, and then make
use of this result to construct radiating star models of the Vaidya type. It
turns out that blackholes are generically formed in such models.
