It is shown that a coherent understanding of all quantized phenomena,
including those governed by unitary evolution equations as well as those
related to irreversible quantum measurements, can be achieved in a scenario of
successive nonequilibrium phase transitions, with the lowest hierarchy of these
phase transitions occurring in a ``resonant cavity'' formed by the entire
matter and energy content of the universe. In this formalism, the physical laws
themselves are resonantly-selected and ordered in the universe cavity in a
hierarchical manner, and the values of fundamental constants are determined
through a Generalized Mach's Principle. The existence of a preferred reference
frame in this scenario is shown to be consistent with the relational nature of
the origin of physical laws. Covariant unitary evolution is shown to connect
smoothly with the reduction of wavefunction in the preferred frame during
quantum measurement. The superluminal nature of quantum processes in the lowest
hierarchy coexists with the universal speed limit obeyed by processes in higher
hierarchies. A natural quantum-to-classical transition is also obtained which
is stable against the diffusive tendency of the unitary quantum evolution
processes. In this formalism a realistic quasi-classical ontology is
established for the foundations of quantum mechanics.
