We present a systematic density functional theory study of the electronic
structure of copper phthalocyanine (CuPc), using several different (semi)-local
and hybrid functionals, and compare the results to experimental photoemission
data. We show that semi-local functionals fail qualitatively for CuPc,
primarily because of under-binding of localized orbitals due to
self-interaction errors. We discuss an appropriate choice of functional for
studies of CuPc/metal interfaces and suggest the Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof
screened hybrid functional as a suitable compromise functional.
