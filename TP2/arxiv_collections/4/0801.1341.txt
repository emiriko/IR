We start with elementary algebraic theory of factorization of linear ordinary
differential equations developed in the period 1880-1930. After exposing these
classical results we sketch more sophisticated algorithmic approaches developed
in the last 20 years.
  The main part of this paper is devoted to modern generalizations of the
notion of factorization to the case of systems of linear partial differential
equations and their relation with explicit solvability of nonlinear partial
differential equations based on some constructions from the theory of abelian
categories.
