We present the exact solution of the Klein-Gordon equation in D-dimensions in
the presence of the noncentral equal scalar and vector pseudoharmonic potential
plus the new ring-shaped potential using the Nikiforov-Uvarov method. We obtain
the exact bound-state energy levels and the corresponding eigen functions for a
spin-zero particles. We also find that the solution for this noncentral
ring-shaped pseudoharmonic potential can be reduced to the three-dimensional
pseudoharmonic solution once the coupling constant of the noncentral part of
the potential becomes zero.
