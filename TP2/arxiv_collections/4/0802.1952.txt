We introduce and study a transfer map between ideals of the universal
enveloping algebras of two members of a reductive dual pair of Lie algebras.
Its definition is motivated by the approach to the real Howe duality through
the theory of Capelli identities. We prove that this map provides a lower bound
on the annihilators of theta lifts of representations with a fixed annihilator
ideal. We also show that in the algebraic stable range, transfer respects the
class of quantizations of nilpotent orbit closures. As an application, we
explicitly describe quantizations of small nilpotent orbits of general linear
and orthogonal Lie algebras and give presentations of certain rings of
algebraic differential operators. We consider two algebraic versions of Howe
duality and reformulate our results in terms of noncommutative Capelli
identities.
