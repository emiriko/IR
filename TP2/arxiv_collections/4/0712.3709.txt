Taking up a method devised by Taylor and Wheeler and collecting pieces of
their work we offer a self-contained derivation of the formulae giving both the
precession of the orbit of a planet around the Sun and the deflection angle of
a light pulse passing near the Sun in the framework of General Relativity. The
demonstration uses only elementary algebra without resorting to tensor
formalism. No prior knowledge in relativity is needed to follow the
presentation.
