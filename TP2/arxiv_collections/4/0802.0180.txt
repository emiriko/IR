We consider models built on $AdS_5\otimes S^5/\Gamma$ orbifold
compactifications of the type $IIB$ superstring, where $\Gamma$ is the abelian
group $Z_n$. An attractive three family $\mathcal{N}=0$ SUSY model is found for
$n=7$ that is a modified Pati--Salam Model which reduced to the Standard Model
after symmetry breaking.
