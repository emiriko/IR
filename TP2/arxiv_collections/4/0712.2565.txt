Inspired by Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen-Bohm experiments with photons, we
construct an event-based simulation model in which every essential element in
the ideal experiment has a counterpart. The model satisfies Einstein's criteria
of local causality and does not rely on concepts of quantum and probability
theory. We consider experiments in which the averages correspond to those of a
singlet and product state of a system of two $S=1/2$ particles. The data is
analyzed according to the experimental procedure, employing a time window to
identify pairs. We study how the time window and the passage time of the
photons, which depends on the relative angle between their polarization and the
polarizer's direction, influences the correlations, demonstrating that the
properties of the optical elements in the observation stations affect the
correlations although the stations are separated spatially and temporarily. We
show that the model can reproduce results which are considered to be
intrinsically quantum mechanical.
