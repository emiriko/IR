Using a sample of over 600 million phi->K+K- decays collected at the Dafne
e+e- collider, we have measured with the KLOE detector the absolute branching
ratios for the charged kaon semileptonic decays, K+/- -> p0 e nu (gamma) (Ke3)
and K+/- -> p0 mu nu (gamma) (Kmu3). The results, BR(Ke3) = 0.04965 +/-
0.00038_{stat} +/- 0.00037_{syst} and BR(Kmu3) = 0.03233 +/- 0.00029_{stat} +/-
0.00026_{syst}, are inclusive of radiation. Accounting for correlations, we
derive the ratio Kmu3/Ke3 = 0.6511+/-0.0064. Using the semileptonic form
factors measured in the same experiment, we obtain V_{us}f_{+}(0) = 0.2141 +/-
0.0013.
