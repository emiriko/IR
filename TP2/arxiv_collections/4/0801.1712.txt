We report on the experimental observation of the beaming effect in photonic
crystals enhanced via surface modes. We experimentally map the spatial field
distribution of energy emitted from a subwavelength photonic crystal waveguide
into free-space, rendering with crisp clarity the diffractionless beaming of
energy. Our experimental data agree well with our numerical studies of the
beaming enhancement in photonic crystals with modulated surfaces. Without loss
of generality, we study the beaming effect in a photonic crystal scaled to
microwave frequencies and demonstrate the technological capacity to deliver
long-range, wavelength-scaled beaming of energy.
