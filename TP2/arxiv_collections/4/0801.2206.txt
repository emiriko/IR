The detector for imaging of explosions (DIMEX) is in operation at the
synchrotron radiation (SR) beam-line at VEPP-3 electron ring at Budker INP
since 2002. DIMEX is based on one-coordinate gas ionization chamber filled with
Xe-CO2(3:1) mixture at 7atm, and active Frisch-grid made of Gas Electron
Multiplier (GEM). The detector has spatial resolution of ~0.2mm and dynamic
range of ~100 that allows to realize the precision of signal measurement at a
percent level. The frame rate can be tuned up to 8 MHz (125 ns per image) and
up to 32 images can be stored in one shot. At present DIMEX is used with the
X-ray beam from 2T wiggler that has ~20 keV average energy. Future possibility
to install similar detector at the SR beam-line at VEPP-4 electron ring is
discussed.
