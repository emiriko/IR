We discuss the two-slit experiment and the Aharonov-Bohm (AB) experiment in
the magnetic field. In such a case the electron moving in the magnetic field
produces so called synchrotron radiation. In other words the photons are
emitted from the points of the electron trajectory and it means that the
trajectory of electron is visible in the synchrotron radiation spectrum. The
axiomatic system of quantum mechanics does not enable to define the trajectory
of the elementary particle. The two-slit experiment and AB experiment in a
magnetic field was never performed and it means that they are the missing
experiments of quantum mechanics. The extension of the discussion to the
cosmical rays moving in the magnetic field of the Saturn magnetosphere and its
rings is mentioned. It is related to the probe CASSINI. The solution of the
problem in the framework of the hydrodynamical model of quantum mechanics and
the nonlinear quantum mechanics is also mentioned.
