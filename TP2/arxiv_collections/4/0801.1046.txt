An overview on recent developments in thermal interfaces is given with a
focus on a novel thermal interface technology that allows the formation of 2-3
times thinner bondlines with strongly improved thermal properties at lower
assembly pressures. This is achieved using nested hierarchical surface channels
to control the particle stacking with highly particle-filled materials.
Reliability testing with thermal cycling has also demonstrated a decrease in
thermal resistance after extended times with longer overall lifetime compared
to a flat interface.
