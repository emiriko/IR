In this dissertation we use sophisticated numerical methods in order to
examine ground-state (GS) properties of two types of quantum systems with
electron electron interactions: A quantum dot (QD) and a nano-wire. In the
first half of the work we study a system of a single level coupled to a
one-dimensional wire with interacting spinless electrons, when the wire is
either clean or disordered. We utilize the density-matrix renormalization-group
(DMRG) method to investigate the influence of the level on several
thermodynamic properties of the clean interacting wire, which can be in one of
two phases: Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid and charge density wave phases. When the
wire is disordered, we investigate the Friedel oscillations, exploring the
difference between the two phases and comparing them to the clean
non-interacting case, for which we develop an exact formula for the
oscillations. In the second half of the dissertation we study two cases of an
isolated two-dimensional QD. We begin by an investigation of a new numerical
method, the particle-hole DMRG (PH-DMRG), which is used to calculate the GS
energy of a disordered QD consisting of interacting spinless electrons. We show
that this method is much more accurate than the Hartree-Fock method, and we
suggest an improvement of the algorithm, which reduces the error rate by almost
30 percents. Finally we study the magnetization of a QD with spin 1/2
electrons, in the presence of spin-orbit coupling and interactions. We
calculate the g-factor and the expectation values of the spin operators in the
GS, and find that when the QD is occupied by an even number of electrons, the
GS can have a finite magnetization.
