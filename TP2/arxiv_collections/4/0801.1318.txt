We present a spectrum of experimental data on the fractional quantum Hall
effect (FQHE) states in the first excited Landau level, obtained in an
ultrahigh mobility two-dimensional electron system (2DES) and at very low
temperatures and report the following results: For the even-denominator FQHE
states, the sample dependence of the nu=5/2 state clearly shows that disorder
plays an important role in determining the energy gap at nu=5/2. For the
developing nu=19/8 FQHE state the temperature dependence of the Rxx minimum
implies an energy gap of ~5mK.The energy gaps of the odd-denominator FQHE
states at nu=7/3 and 8/3 also increase with decreasing disorder, similar to the
gap at 5/2 state. Unexpectedly and contrary to earlier data on lower mobility
samples, in this ultra-high quality specimen, the nu=13/5 state is missing,
while its particle-hole conjugate state, the nu=12/5 state, is a fully
developed FQHE state. We speculate that this disappearance might indicate a
spin polarization of the nu=13/5 state. Finally, the temperature dependence is
studied for the two-reentrant integer quantum Hall states around nu=5/2 and is
found to show a very narrow temperature range for the transition from quantized
to classical value.
