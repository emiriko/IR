Based on quantum field theory at finite temperature we carried out new
results for two-particle Bose-Einstein correlation (BEC) function ${C_2}(Q)$ in
case of light hadrons. The important parameters of BEC function related to the
size of the emitting source, mean multiplicity, stochastic forces range with
the particle energy and mass dependence, and the temperature of the source are
obtained for the first time. Not only the correlation between identical hadrons
are explored but even the off-correlation between non-identical particles are
proposed. The correlations of two bosons in 4-momentum space presented in this
paper offer useful and instructive complimentary viewpoints to theoretical and
experimental works in multiparticle femtoscopy and interferometry measurements
at hadron colliders. This paper is the first one to the next opening series of
works concerning the searching of BEC with experimental data where the
parameters above mentioned will be retrieved.
