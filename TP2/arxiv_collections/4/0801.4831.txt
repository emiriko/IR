The conductance of a tunnel point-contact in an STM-like geometry having a
single defect placed below the surface is investigated theoretically. The
effect of multiple electron scattering by the defect after reflections by the
metal surface is taken into account. In the approximation of s-wave scattering
the dependence of the conductance on the applied voltage and the position of
the defect is obtained. The results are illustrated for a model s-wave phase
shift describing Kondo-resonance scattering. We demonstrate that multiple
electron scattering by the magnetic impurity plays a decisive role in the
point-contact conductance at voltages near the Kondo resonance. We find that
the sign and shape of the Kondo anomaly depends on the position of the defect.
