A spin-tunnel-junction based on manganites, with La$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$MnO$_3$
(LSMO) as ferromagnetic metallic electrodes and the undoped parent compound
LaMnO$_3$ (LMO) as insulating barrier, is here theoretically discussed using
double exchange model Hamiltonians and numerical techniques. For an even number
of LMO layers, the ground state is shown to have anti-parallel LSMO magnetic
moments. This highly resistive, but fragile, state is easily destabilized by
small magnetic fields, which orient the LSMO moments in the direction of the
field. The magnetoresistance associated with this transition is very large,
according to Monte Carlo and Density Matrix Renormalization Group studies. The
influence of temperature, the case of an odd number of LMO layers, and the
differences between LMO and SrTiO$_3$ as barriers are also addressed. General
trends are discussed.
