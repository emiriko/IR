We report low-temperature specific heat studies on single-crystalline
ternary-iron silicide superconductor Lu$_{2}$Fe$_{3}$Si$_{5}$ with$T_c$ = 6.1 K
down to $\sim T_c/20$. We confirm a reduced normalized jump in specific heat at
$T_c$, and find that the specific heat divided by temperature $C/T$ shows
sudden drop at $\sim T_c/5$ and goes to zero with further decreasing
temperature. These results indicate the presence of two distinct
superconducting gaps in Lu$_{2}$Fe$_{3}$Si$_{5}$, similar to a typical two-gap
superconductor MgB$_{2}$. We also report Hall coefficients, band structure
calculation, and the anisotropy of upper critical fields for
Lu$_{2}$Fe$_{3}$Si$_{5}$, which support the anisotropic multiband nature and
reinforce the existence of two superconducting gaps in
Lu$_{2}$Fe$_{3}$Si$_{5}$.
