We present a Langevin approach to describe the steady-state dynamics of
one-dimensional granular media fluidized by a vibrating bottom plate. We adopt
a linear Langevin equation to describe the motion of the center of mass. Within
this framework, we derive analytical expressions for several macroscopic
quantities. We also predict the power spectrum for the height of the center of
mass. We find good agreement between our theoretical predictions and extensive
event-driven molecular dynamics simulations.
