In this paper, a new non-search based synthesis algorithm for reversible
circuits is proposed. Compared with the widely used search-based methods, our
algorithm is guarantied to produce a result and can lead to a solution with
much fewer steps. To evaluate the proposed method, several circuits taken from
the literature are used. The experimental results corroborate the expected
findings.
