We present in this talk a recent investigation on the magnetic susceptibility
(chi) of the QCD vacuum at finite density, utilizing the nonlocal chiral quark
model from the instanton vacuum. We take into account the nonzero current-quark
mass (m_q) explicitly to consider the effect of explicit flavor SU(3) symmetry
breaking. It turns out that, when we turn on the current-quark mass, chi
becomes smaller, indicating less response to the externally induced
electromagnetic field, in comparison to that for m_q=0.
