We re-analyse the effect of corrections from canonical normalisation of
kinetic terms on the quark and lepton mixing angles. This type of corrections
emerges, for example, from effective higher-dimensional Kahler potential
operators in the context of locally supersymmetric models of flavour. In
contrast to previous studies we find that the necessary procedure of redefining
the fields in order to restore canonically normalised kinetic terms, i.e.
canonical normalisation, can lead to significant corrections to the fermion
mixing angles (as determined from the superpotential). Such potentially large
effects are characteristic of flavour models based on non-Abelian family
symmetries, where some of the possible Kahler potential (and superpotential)
operators, in particular those associated with the third family, are only
mildly suppressed. We investigate under which conditions the messenger sector
of such flavour models generates such Kahler potential operators for which the
canonical normalisation effects are sizeable, and under which conditions these
operators may be absent and canonical normalisation effects are small. As
explicit examples for potentially relevant CN effects, we will discuss the
corrections to the CKM matrix element |V_{cb}| as well as corrections to
tri-bimaximal neutrino mixing.
