BACKGROUND: Prostate brachytherapy consists in placing radioactive seeds for
tumour destruction under transrectal ultrasound imaging (TRUS) control. It
requires prostate delineation from the images for dose planning. Because
ultrasound imaging is patient- and operator-dependent, we have proposed to fuse
MRI data to TRUS data to make image processing more reliable. The technical
accuracy of this approach has already been evaluated. METHODS: We present work
in progress concerning the evaluation of the approach from the dosimetry
viewpoint. The objective is to determine what impact this system may have on
the treatment of the patient. Dose planning is performed from initial TRUS
prostate contours and evaluated on contours modified by data fusion. RESULTS:
For the eight patients included, we demonstrate that TRUS prostate volume is
most often underestimated and that dose is overestimated in a correlated way.
However, dose constraints are still verified for those eight patients.
CONCLUSIONS: This confirms our initial hypothesis.
