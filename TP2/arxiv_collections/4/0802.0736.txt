We have studied the quantum phase transition between the antiferromagnetic
and spin liquid phase for the two dimensional anisotropic Kondo-necklace model.
The bond operator formalism has been implemented to transform the spin
Hamiltonian to a bosonic one. We have used the Green's function approach
including a hard core repulsion to find the low energy excitation spectrum of
the model. The bosonic excitations become gapless at the quantum critical point
where the phase transition from the Kondo singlet state to long range
antiferromagnetic order takes place. We have studied the effect of both
inter-site (delta) and local (Delta) anisotropies on the critical point and on
the critical exponent of the excitation gap in the paramagnetic phase. We have
also compared our results with previous bond operator mean field calculations.
