According to an idea that the quark and lepton mass spectra originate in a
VEV structure of a U(3)-flavor nonet scalar \Phi, the mass spectra of the
down-quarks and charged leptons are investigated. The U(3) flavor symmetry is
spontaneously and completely broken by non-zero and non-degenerated VEVs of
$\Phi$, without passing any subgroup of U(3). The ratios
(m_e+m_\mu+m_\tau)/(\sqrt{m_e}+\sqrt{m_\mu}+\sqrt{m_\tau})^2 and \sqrt{m_e
m_\mu m_\tau}/(\sqrt{m_e}+\sqrt{m_\mu}+\sqrt{m_\tau})^3 are investigated based
on a toy model.
