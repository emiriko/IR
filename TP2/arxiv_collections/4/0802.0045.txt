Let $X\subset\mathbb P^{n+1}$ be a smooth complex projective hypersurface. In
this paper we show that, if the degree of $X$ is large enough, then there exist
global sections of the bundle of invariant jet differentials of order $n$ on
$X$, vanishing on an ample divisor. We also prove a logarithmic version,
effective in low dimension, for the log-pair $(\mathbb P^n,D)$, where $D$ is a
smooth irreducible divisor of high degree. Moreover, these result are sharp,
\emph{i.e.} one cannot have such jet differentials of order less than $n$.
