Super-high resolution laser-based angle-resolved photoemission (ARPES)
measurements have been carried out on the high energy electron dynamics in
Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8 (Bi2212) high temperature superconductor. Momentum dependent
measurements provide new insights on the nature of high energy kink at 200~400
meV and high energy dispersions. The strong dichotomy between the MDC- and
EDC-derived bands is revealed which raises critical issues about its origin and
which one represents intrinsic band structure. The MDC-derived high energy
features are affected by the high-intensity valence band at higher binding
energy and may not be intrinsic.
