We discuss the relevance of the improved mean-field slave-fermion theory to
describe the Nagaoka ($U=\infty$) limit of the Hubbard model. In this theory
the crucial on-site constraint of no double electron occupancy is taken into
account rigorously prior to the mean-field approximation. At one-loop
approximation the effective mean-field action shows a long-range ferromagnetic
order over the whole doping range. This indicates that the slave-fermion
mean-field theory does not constitute an appropriate framework to describe the
physics of the Nagaoka phase. We discuss the drawbacks of this mean-field
theory and present some results on the derivation of a low-energy effective
spin action to describe the Nagaoka phase beyond the mean-field approximation.
