We consider eigenfunctions of the Laplace-Beltrami operator on special
surfaces of revolution. For this separable system, the nodal domains of the
(real) eigenfunctions form a checker-board pattern, and their number $\nu_n$ is
proportional to the product of the angular and the "surface" quantum numbers.
Arranging the wave functions by increasing values of the Laplace-Beltrami
spectrum, we obtain the nodal sequence, whose statistical properties we study.
In particular we investigate the distribution of the normalized counts
$\frac{\nu_n}{n}$ for sequences of eigenfunctions with $K \le n\le K + \Delta
K$ where $K,\Delta K \in \mathbb{N}$. We show that the distribution approaches
a limit as $K,\Delta K\to\infty$ (the classical limit), and study the leading
corrections in the semi-classical limit. With this information, we derive the
central result of this work: the nodal sequence of a mirror-symmetric surface
is sufficient to uniquely determine its shape (modulo scaling).
