We study quantum Loschmidt echo, or fidelity, in the triangle map whose
classical counterpart has linear instability and weak chaos. Numerically, three
regimes of fidelity decay have been found with respect to the perturbation
strength $\epsilon$. In the regime of weak perturbation, the fidelity decays as
$\exp (-c\epsilon^2 t^{\gamma})$ with $\gamma \simeq 1.7$. In the regime of
strong perturbation, the fidelity is approximately a function of $\epsilon
t^{2.5}$, which is predicted for the classical fidelity [G. Casati, {\it et
al}, Phys.Rev.Lett.{\bf 94}, 114101 (2005)], and decays slower than power-law
decay for long times. In an intermediate regime, the fidelity has approximately
an exponential decay $\exp (-c' \epsilon t)$.
