An application of the thermodynamic field theory (TFT) to transport processes
in L-mode tokamak plasmas is presented. The nonlinear corrections to the linear
(Onsager) transport coefficients in the collisional regimes are derived. A
quite encouraging result is the appearance of an asymmetry between the
Pfirsch-Schlueter (P-S) ion and electron transport coefficients: the latter
presents a nonlinear correction, which is absent for the ions, and makes the
radial electron coefficients much larger than the former. Explicit calculations
and comparisons between the neoclassical results and the TFT predictions for
JET plasmas are also reported. We found that the nonlinear electron P-S
transport coefficients exceed the values provided by neoclassical theory by a
factor, which may be of the order 100. The nonlinear classical coefficients
exceed the neoclassical ones by a factor, which may be of order 2. The
expressions of the ion transport coefficients, determined by the neoclassical
theory in these two regimes, remain unaltered. The low-collisional regimes
i.e., the plateau and the banana regimes, are analyzed in the second part of
this work.
