The Doppler shift considered in general relativity involves mixed
contributions of distinct, gravitational and kinematical origins and for most
metrics or trajectories it takes a complex form. The expression for the Doppler
shift may simplify due to particular symmetries. In Schwarzschild spacetime it
factorizes in the case of radial fall for an observer and radial null geodesic.
The resulting expression is composed of factors that can be identified with
contributions arising from classical, special relativistic and general
relativistic origins. This result turns out to be more general: it holds for
the whole class of observers travelling parallel to the spatial path of null
geodesics when receiving the signal. It also holds for a particular type of
in-fall in the case of a Kerr metric.
