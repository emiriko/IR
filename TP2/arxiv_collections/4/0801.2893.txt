Calculations using the (exact) fermionic functional renormalization group are
usually truncated at the second order of the corresponding hierarchy of coupled
ordinary differential equations. We present a method for the systematic
determination of higher order vertex functions. This method is applied to a
study of transport properties of various correlated quantum dot systems. It is
shown that for large Coulomb correlations higher order vertex functions cannot
be neglected, and a static approximation is insufficient.
