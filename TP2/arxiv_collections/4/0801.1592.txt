Born differential cross sections and the lowest-order radiative correction to
them are obtained in the kinematics of large-angle final photons emission in
high-energy electron-positron annihilation processes. Taking into account
possible emission of real soft and hard photons in collinear kinematics we show
the validity of the Drell-Yan form of differential cross section with the
nonsinglet structure functions of initial leptons. The leading and next-to
leading contribution to the cross sections is obtained. The relevant numerical
estimations are presented.
