Using the recently introduced boundary form factor bootstrap equations, the
form factors of boundary exponential operators in the sinh-Gordon model are
constructed. The ultraviolet scaling dimension and the normalization of these
operators are checked against previously known results. The construction
presented in this paper can be applied to determine form factors of relevant
primary boundary operators in general integrable boundary quantum field
theories.
