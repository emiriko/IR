Lepton-flavour violating tau-decays are predicted in many extensions of the
Standard Model at a rate observable at future collider experiments. In this
article we focus on the decay tau to mu mu antimu, which is a promising channel
to observe lepton-flavour violation at the Large Hadron Collider LHC. We
present analytic expressions for the differential decay width derived from a
model-independent effective Lagrangian with general four-fermion operators, and
estimate the experimental acceptance for detecting the decay tau to mu mu
antimu at the LHC. Specific emphasis is given to decay angular distributions
and how they can be used to discriminate new physics models. We provide
specific predictions for various extensions of the Standard Model, including
supersymmetric, little Higgs and technicolour models.
