A family of LDPC codes, called LU(3,q) codes, has been constructed from
q-regular bipartite graphs. Recently, P. Sin and Q. Xiang determined the
dimensions of these codes in the case that q is a power of an odd prime. They
also obtained a lower bound for the dimension of an LU(3,q) code when q is a
power of 2. In this paper we prove that this lower bound is the exact dimension
of the LU(3,q) code. The proof involves the geometry of symplectic generalized
quadrangles, the representation theory of Sp(4,q), and the ring of polynomials.
