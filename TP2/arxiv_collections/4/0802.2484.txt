Chiral expansions of the two-pion exchange components of both two- and
three-nucleon forces are reviewed and a discussion is made of the predicted
pattern of hierarchies. The strength of the scalar-isoscalar central potential
is found to be too large and to defy expectations from the symmetry. The causes
of this effect can be understood by studying the nucleon scalar form factor.
