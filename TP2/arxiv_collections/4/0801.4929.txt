We have performed a coupled channel study of the meson-meson S-waves
involving isospins (I) 0, 1/2 and 3/2 up to 2 GeV. For the first time the
channels \pi\pi, K\bar{K}, \eta\eta, \sigma\sigma, \eta\eta', \eta'\eta',
\rho\rho, \omega\omega, \omega\phi$, \phi\phi, a_1\pi and \pi^*\pi are
considered. All the resonances with masses below 2 GeV for I=0 and 1/2 are
generated by the approach. We identify the f_0(1710) and a pole at 1.6 GeV,
which is an important contribution to the f_0(1500), as glueballs. This is
based on an accurate agreement of our results with predictions of lattice QCD
and the chiral suppression of the coupling of a scalar glueball to \bar{q}q.
Another nearby pole, mainly corresponding to the f_0(1370), is a pure octet
state not mixed with the glueball.
