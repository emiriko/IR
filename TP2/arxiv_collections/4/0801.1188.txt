We have analyzed by Scanning Tunnelling Microscopy (STM) thin films made of
few (3-5) graphene layers grown on the C terminated face of 6H-SiC in order to
identify the nature of the azimuthal disorder reported in this material. We
observe superstructures which are interpreted as Moir\'e patterns due to a
misorientation angle between consecutive layers. The presence of stacking
faults is expected to lead to electronic properties reminiscent of single layer
graphene even for multilayer samples. Our results indicate that this apparent
electronic decoupling of the layers can show up in STM data.
