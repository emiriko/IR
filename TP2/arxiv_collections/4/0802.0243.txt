Phonon-related decoherence effects in a quantum double-well two-level
subsystem coupled to a solid are studied theoretically by the example of
deformation phonons. Expressions for the reduced density matrix at T=0 are
derived beyond the Markovian approximation by means of explicit solution of the
non-stationary Schrodinger equation for the interacting electron-phonon system
at the initial stage of its evolution. It is shown that as long as the
difference between the energies of the electron in the left and the right well
greatly exceeds the energy of the electron tunneling between the minima of the
double-well potential, decoherence is primarily due to dephasing processes.
This case corresponds to a strongly asymmetric potential and spatially
separated eigenfunctions localized in the vicinity of one or another potential
minimum. In the opposite case of the symmetric potential, the decoherence stems
from the relaxation processes, which may be either "resonant" (at relatively
long times) or "nonresonant" (at short times), giving rise to qualitatively
different temporal evolution of the electron state. The results obtained are
discussed in the context of quantum information processing based on the quantum
bits encoded in electron charge degrees of freedom.
