The concept of a judgment as a logical action which introduces new
information into a deductive system is examined. This leads to a way of
mathematically representing implication which is distinct from the familiar
material implication, according to which "If A then B" is considered to be
equivalent to "B or not-A". This leads, in turn, to a resolution of the paradox
of the raven.
