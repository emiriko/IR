Most of model considerations of the hidden nucleon strangeness, as well as
some preliminary experimental evidence, led to the expectations of relatively
sizeable strange vector form factors of the proton. For example, it seemed that
the contribution of the fluctuating strange quark-antiquark pairs accounts for
as much as one tenth of the proton's magnetic moment. By the same token, baryon
models which failed to produce the "vector strangeness" of the nucleon seemed
disfavored. Recently, however, more accurate measurements and more
sophisticated data analysis, as well as lattice simulations, revealed that the
form factors associated with the vector strangeness of the nucleon are much
smaller than thought previously; in fact, due to the experimental
uncertainties, the measured strange vector-current proton form factors may be
consistent with zero. In the light of that, we re-asses the merit of the baryon
models leading to little or no vector strangeness of the nucleon. It is done on
the concrete example of the baryon model which essentially amounts to the MIT
bag enriched by the diluted instanton liquid.
