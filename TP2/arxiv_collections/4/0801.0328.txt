We experimentally demonstrate a bright pulsed source of correlated photon
pairs at 1550 nm telecom band by pumping 300 m dispersion shifted fiber with a
4 ps pulse train. We investigate the coherence property of the source by
measuring the second order intensity correlation function $g^{(2)}$ of
individual signal (idler) photons. A preliminary Hong-Ou-Mandel type two-photon
interference experiment with two such sources confirms the high temporal and
spatial coherence of the source. The source is suitable for multi-photon
quantum interference of independent sources, required in quantum information
processing.
