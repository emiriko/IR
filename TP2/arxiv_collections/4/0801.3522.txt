In field theory the scattering about spatially extended objects, such as
solitons, is commonly described by small amplitude fluctuations. Since soliton
configurations often break internal symmetries, excitations exist that arise
from quantizing the modes that are introduced to restore these symmetries.
These modes represent collective distortions and cannot be treated as small
amplitude fluctuations. Here we present a method to embrace their contribution
to the scattering matrix. In essence this allows us to compute the decay widths
of such collective excitations. As an example we consider the Skyrme model for
baryons and explain that the method helps to solve the long--standing Yukawa
problem in chiral soliton models.
