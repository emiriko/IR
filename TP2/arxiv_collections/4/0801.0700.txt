One of considered nowadays scenarios of proton - nucleus reaction is
spallation. Its motivation is based on experimental final-state observations of
one heavy nucleus, a small number of light fragments and numerous individual
nucleons. It is theoretically described as two step process involving energy
deposition in the target nucleus and subsequent evaporation. Several models,
based on different assumptions, have been constructed in order to describe the
spallation process. The main subject of this work is description of global
average properties of proton induced spallation reactions in wide range of
projectile energy (0.1 - 10 GeV) and mass of target nuclei. This is
investigated within Hadron String Dynamics (HSD) model, based on Boltzmann -
Uehling - Uhlenbeck (BUU) equation, supplemented by a statistical evaporation
model for the second stage of the reaction. It has been shown that spallation
is the most probable scenario of proton - nucleus reaction. Proton induced
reactions, in considered here incident energy range, are visibly non-invasive
processes. Properties of residual nuclei after the first stage of the reaction
are weakly dependent on incident energy, but strongly dependent on mass of
target. The second stage of the reaction is a competition of evaporation and
fission. Results obtained from the HSD model vary smoothly as function of
proton incident energy and mass of target, so interpolation of the results is
quite feasible.
