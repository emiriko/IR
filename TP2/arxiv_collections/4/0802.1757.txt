We study thermodynamic quantities and examine the stability of a black hole
in a cavity inspired by the noncommutative geometry. It turns out that
thermodynamic behavior of the noncommutative black hole is analogous to that of
the Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole in the near extremal limit. Moreover, we
identify the noncommutative parameter with the squared electric charge with
some constants.
