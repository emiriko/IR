We employ a combination of optical UV- and electron-beam-lithography to
create an atom chip combining sub-micron wire structures with larger
conventional wires on a single substrate. The new multi-layer fabrication
enables crossed wire configurations, greatly enhancing the flexibility in
designing potentials for ultra cold quantum gases and Bose-Einstein
condensates. Large current densities of >6 x 10^7 A/cm^2 and high voltages of
up to 65 V across 0.3 micron gaps are supported by even the smallest wire
structures. We experimentally demonstrate the flexibility of the next
generation atom chip by producing Bose-Einstein condensates in magnetic traps
created by a combination of wires involving all different fabrication methods
and structure sizes.
