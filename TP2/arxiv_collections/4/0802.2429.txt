In this paper we introduce a new selection scheme in cellular genetic
algorithms (cGAs). Anisotropic Selection (AS) promotes diversity and allows
accurate control of the selective pressure. First we compare this new scheme
with the classical rectangular grid shapes solution according to the selective
pressure: we can obtain the same takeover time with the two techniques although
the spreading of the best individual is different. We then give experimental
results that show to what extent AS promotes the emergence of niches that
support low coupling and high cohesion. Finally, using a cGA with anisotropic
selection on a Quadratic Assignment Problem we show the existence of an
anisotropic optimal value for which the best average performance is observed.
Further work will focus on the selective pressure self-adjustment ability
provided by this new selection scheme.
