We respond to criticism of our paper "Paradox in Wave-Paricle Duality for
Non-Perturbative Measurements". We disagree with Steuernagel's derivation of
the visibility of the Afshar experiment. To calculate the fringe visibility,
Steuernagel utilizes two different experimental situations, i.e. the wire grid
in the pattern minima and in the pattern maxima. In our assessment, this
proceduere cannot lead to the correct result for the complementarity properties
of wave-particle in one particular experimental set-up.
