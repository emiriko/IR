The present paper develops the ideas introduced in {\em cond-mat/0312673}.
The construction of a hybrid discrete-continuous model of layered
superconductors is briefly presented. The model bases on the classic
Lawrence-Doniach scenario with admitting, however, long-range interactions
between atomic planes. Moreover, apart from Josephson couplings they involve
the proximity effects. The range of interactions, K, can, in principle, be
arbitrary large. The solutions corresponding to the range K=2 are exposed.
  The fundamental excitations are understood as deviations from stable ground
states.The formulae for energy of those excitations are constructed. The
possible shapes of dispersion curves are analysed. For each type of shape the
corresponding values of physically measurable quantities like effective maa and
bandwidth are expressed by coupling parameters.
