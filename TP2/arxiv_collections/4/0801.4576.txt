Low-frequency 1/f noise is ubiquitous, and dominates the signal-to-noise
performance in nanodevices. Here we investigate the noise characteristics of
single-layer and bilayer graphene nano-devices, and uncover an unexpected 1/f
noise behavior for bilayer devices. Graphene is a single layer of graphite,
where carbon atoms form a 2D honeycomb lattice. Despite the similar
composition, bilayer graphene (two graphene monolayers stacked in the natural
graphite order) is a distinct 2D system with a different band structure and
electrical properties. In graphene monolayers, the 1/f noise is found to follow
Hooge's empirical relation with a noise parameter comparable to that of bulk
semiconductors. However, this 1/f noise is strongly suppressed in bilayer
graphene devices, and exhibits an unusual dependence on the carrier density,
different from most other materials. The unexpected noise behavior in graphene
bilayers is associated with its unique band structure that varies with the
charge distribution among the two layers, resulting in an effective screening
of potential fluctuations due to external impurity charges. The findings here
point to exciting opportunities for graphene bilayers in low-noise
applications.
