The decrease in the symmetry energy of hot nuclei populated in $^{58}$Ni +
$^{58}$Ni, $^{58}$Fe + $^{58}$Ni and $^{58}$Fe + $^{58}$Fe reactions at beam
energies of 30, 40, and 47 MeV/nucleon, as a function of excitation energy is
studied. It is observed that this decrease is mainly a consequence of
increasing expansion or decreasing density rather than the increasing
temperature. The results are in good agreement with the recently reported
microscopic calculation based on the Thomas-Fermi approach. An empirical
relation to study the symmetry energy of finite nuclei in various mass region
is proposed.
