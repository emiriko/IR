In this paper, a new mesoscopic polygon which possesses smooth transition at
its corners is proposed. Because of the particularity of structure, this kind
of mesoscopic polygon can also be a geometrical supperlattice. The geometrical
effects on the electron states and persistent current are investigated
comprehensively in the presence of magnetic flux. We find that the particular
geometric structure of the polygon induces an effective periodic potential
which results in gaps in the energy spectrum. The changes of gaps show the
consistency with the geometrical twoness of this new polygon. This electronic
structure and the corresponding physical properties are found to be periodic
with period $\phi_{0}$ in the magnetic flux $\phi $ and can be controlled by
the geometric method. We also consider the Rahsba spin-orbit interaction which
make the energy levels splitting newly to double and leads to an additional
small zigzag in one period of the persistent current. These new phenomena may
be useful for the applications in quantum device design in the future.
