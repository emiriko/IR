Using coupled equations for the bosonic and fermionic order parameters, we
construct families of gap solitons (GSs) in a nearly one-dimensional Bose-Fermi
mixture trapped in a periodic optical-lattice (OL) potential, the boson and
fermion components being in the states of the BEC and BCS superfluid,
respectively. Fundamental GSs are compact states trapped, essentially, in a
single cell of the lattice. Full families of such solutions are constructed in
the first two bandgaps of the OL-induced spectrum, by means of variational and
numerical methods, which are found to be in good agreement. The families
include both intra-gap and inter-gap solitons, with the chemical potentials of
the boson and fermion components falling in the same or different bandgaps,
respectively.Nonfundamental states, extended over several lattice cells, are
constructed too. The GSs are stable against strong perturbations.
