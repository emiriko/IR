We provide various schemes for the splitting up of Quantum information into
parts using the four and five partite cluster states. Explicit protocols for
the Quantum information splitting (QIS) of single and two qubit states are
illustrated. It is found that the four partite cluster state can be used for
the QIS of an entangled state and the five partite cluster state can be used
for QIS of an arbitrary two qubit state. The schemes considered here are also
secure against certain eavesdropping attacks.
