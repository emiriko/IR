We describe and examine entanglement between different degrees of freedom in
multiphoton states based on the permutation properties. From the state
description, the entanglement comes from the permutation asymmetry. According
to the different permutation properties, the multiphoton states can be divided
into several parts. It will help to deal with the multiphoton interference,
which can be used as the measurement of the entanglement.
