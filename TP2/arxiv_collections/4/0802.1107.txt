We present a detailed description of biopolymer translocation through a
nanopore in the presence of a solvent, using an innovative multi-scale
methodology which treats the biopolymer at the microscopic scale as combined
with a self-consistent mesoscopic description for the solvent fluid dynamics.
We report evidence for quantized current blockade depending on the folding
configuration and offer detailed information on the role of hydrodynamic
correlations in speeding-up the translocation process.
