Using ac susceptibility, dc magnetization and heat capacity measurements, we
have investigated the magnetic properties of $Cd_{0.5}Cu_{0.5}Cr_2O_4$.
$Cd_{0.5}Cu_{0.5}Cr_2O_4$ has an extraordinary magnetic phase including a
metastable spin-glass(SG) phase at zero field, a possible phase separation
scenario of AFM/FM above $\sim 0.5T$ field, and at intermediate fields, an
apparent pseudo reentrant spin-glass (RSG) plateau is observed. These phenomena
are closely correlated with the pinning effect of the $Cu^{2+}$ sublattice on
the frustrated lattice.
