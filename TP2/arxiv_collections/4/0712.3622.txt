We study a conserved mass aggregation model with mass-dependent fragmentation
in one dimension. In the model, the whole mass $m$ of a site isotropically
diffuse with unit rate. With rate $\omega$, a mass $m^{\lambda}$ is fragmented
from the site and moves to a randomly selected nearest neighbor site. Since the
fragmented mass is smaller than the whole mass $m$ of a site for $\lambda < 1$,
the on-site attractive interaction exists for the case. For $\lambda = 0$, the
model is known to undergo the condensation phase transitions from a fluid phase
into a condensed phase as the density of total masses ($\rho$) increases beyond
a critical density $\rho_c$. For $0< \lambda <1$, we numerically confirm for
several values of $\omega$ that $\rho_c$ diverges with the system size $L$.
Hence in thermodynamic limit, the condensed phase disappears and no transitions
take place in one dimension. We also explain that there are no transitions in
any dimensions.
