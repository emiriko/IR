``What aspects of a group are unchanged, or stable, under homology
equivalences''? The model theorem in this regard is the 1963 result of J.
Stallings that the lower central series is preserved under any integral
homological equivalence of groups. Various other theorems of this nature have
since appeared. Stallings himself proved similar theorems for homology with
rational or mod p coefficients. These involved different series of groups-
variations of the lower central series. W. Dwyer generalized Stallings'
integral results to larger classes of maps, work that was completed in the
other cases by the authors. More recently the authors proved analogues of the
theorems of Stallings and Dwyer for variations of the derived series. The above
theorems are all different but clearly have much in common. Here we present a
new concept, that of the stability of a subgroup, or a series of subgroups
under a class of maps, that offers a framework in which all of these theorems
can be viewed. We contrast it with homological localization of groups, which is
a previously well-studied framework that might also be applied to these
questions.
