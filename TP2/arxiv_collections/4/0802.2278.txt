Future detectors for high luminosity particle identification and ultra high
energy neutrino observation would benefit from a digitizer capable of recording
sensor elements with high analog bandwidth and large record depth, in a
cost-effective, compact and low-power way. A first version of the Buffered
Large Analog Bandwidth (BLAB1) ASIC has been designed based upon the lessons
learned from the development of the Large Analog Bandwidth Recorder and
Digitizer with Ordered Readout (LABRADOR) ASIC. While this LABRADOR ASIC has
been very successful and forms the basis of a generation of new, large-scale
radio neutrino detectors, its limited sampling depth is a major drawback. A
prototype has been designed and fabricated with 65k deep sampling at
multi-GSa/s operation. We present test results and directions for future
evolution of this sampling technique.
