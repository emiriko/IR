I present a simplified model for the gluon Green's function governing
high-energy QCD dynamics, in arbitrary space-time dimensions. The BFKL integral
equation (either with or without running coupling) reduces to a second order
differential equation that can be solved in terms of Bessel and hypergeometric
functions. Explicit expressions for the gluon density and its anomalous
dimension are derived in MS and Q_0 factorization schemes. This analysis
illustrates the qualitative features of the QCD gluon density in both
factorization schemes. In addition, it clarifies the mathematical properties
and validates the results of the ``gamma-representation'' method proposed by
M.Ciafaloni and myself for extracting resummed next-to-leading-log x anomalous
dimensions of phenomenological relevance in the two schemes.
