By doing quantum Monte Carlo ab initio simulations we show that dipolar
excitons, which are now under experimental study, actually are strongly
correlated systems. Strong correlations manifest in significant deviations of
excitation spectra from the Bogoliubov one, large Bose condensate depletion,
short-range order in the pair correlation function, and peak(s) in the
structure factor.
