We study the problem of synchronizing a general complex network by means of
an adaptive strategy in the case where the network topology is slowly time
varying and every node receives at each time only one aggregate signal from the
set of its neighbors. We introduce an appropriately defined potential that each
node seeks to minimize in order to reach/maintain synchronization. We show that
our strategy is effective in tracking synchronization as well as in achieving
synchronization when appropriate conditions are met.
