We present a global analysis of leptonic and semileptonic kaon decays data,
including all recent results by BNL-E865, KLOE, KTeV, ISTRA+, and NA48.
Experimental results are critically reviewed and combined, taking into account
theoretical (both analytical and numerical) constraints on the semileptonic
kaon form factors. This analysis leads to a very accurate determination of Vus
and allows us to perform several stringent tests of the Standard Model.
