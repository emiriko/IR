Using the CLEO-c detector, we have measured the charm hadronic cross sections
for $e^{+}e^{-}$ annihilations at a total of thirteen center-of-mass energies
between 3.97 and 4.26 GeV. Observed cross sections for the production of
$D\bar{D}$, $D^{*}\bar{D}$, $D^{*}\bar{D}^{*}$, $D_{s}\bar{D}_{s}$,
$D_{s}^{*}\bar{D}_{s}$, and $D_{s}^{*}\bar{D}_{s}^{*}$, in addition to the
total charm cross section are presented. Observed cross sections were
radiatively corrected to obtain tree-level cross sections and R.
