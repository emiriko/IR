We present an extensive computer simulation study of structure formation in
amphiphilic block copolymer solutions after a quench from a homogeneous state.
By using a mesoscopic field-based simulation method, we are able to access time
scales in the range of a second. A phase diagram of final structures is mapped
out as a function of the concentration and solvent-philicity of the copolymers.
A rich spectrum of structures is observed, ranging from spherical and rodlike
micelles and vesicles to toroidal and net-cage micelles. The dynamical pathways
leading to these structures are analyzed in detail, and possible ways to
control the structures are discussed briefly.
