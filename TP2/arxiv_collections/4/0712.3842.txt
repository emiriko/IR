The existence of a special periodic window in the two-dimensional parameter
space of an experimental Chua's circuit is reported. One of the main reasons
that makes such a window special is that the observation of one implies that
other similar periodic windows must exist for other parameter values. However,
such a window has never been experimentally observed, since its size in
parameter space decreases exponentially with the period of the periodic
attractor. This property imposes clear limitations for its experimental
detection.
