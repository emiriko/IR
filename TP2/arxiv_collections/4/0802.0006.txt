Some of the important inequalities associated with quantum entropy are
immediate algebraic consequences of the Hansen-Pedersen-Jensen inequality. A
general argument is given in terms of the matrix perspective of an operator
convex function. A matrix analogue of Mar\'{e}chal's extended perspectives
provides additional inequalities, including a $p+q\leq 1$ result of Lieb.
