The property of extended longitudinal scaling of rapidity distributions was
noticed recently over a broad range of beam energies. It is shown here that
this property is consistent with predictions of the statistical thermal model
up to the highest RHIC beam energies, however, we expect that at LHC energies
the rapidity distribution of produced particles will violate extended
longitudinal scaling.
