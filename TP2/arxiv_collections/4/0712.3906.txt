We discuss the collective behavior of a network of individuals that receive,
process and forward to each other tasks. Given costs they store those tasks in
buffers, choosing optimally the frequency at which to check and process the
buffer. The individual optimizing strategy of each node determines the
aggregate behavior of the network. We find that, under general assumptions, the
whole system exhibits coexistence of equilibria and hysteresis.
