With the advent of the LHC, we will be able to probe New Physics (NP) up to
energy scales almost one order of magnitude larger than it has been possible
with present accelerator facilities. While direct detection of new particles
will be the main avenue to establish the presence of NP at the LHC, indirect
searches will provide precious complementary information, since most probably
it will not be possible to measure the full spectrum of new particles and their
couplings through direct production. In particular, precision measurements and
computations in the realm of flavour physics are expected to play a key role in
constraining the unknown parameters of the Lagrangian of any NP model emerging
from direct searches at the LHC. The aim of Working Group 2 was twofold: on one
hand, to provide a coherent, up-to-date picture of the status of flavour
physics before the start of the LHC; on the other hand, to initiate activities
on the path towards integrating information on NP from high-pT and flavour
data.
