The model of low-energy quantum gravity by the author has the property of
asymptotic freedom at very short distances. The character of transition to
asymptotic freedom is studied here. It is shown that this transition is not
universal, but the one obeys the scaling rule: the range of this transition in
units of $r/E^{1/2}$, where $r$ is a distance between particles and $E$ is an
energy of the screening particle, is the same for any micro-particle. This
range for a proton is between $10^{-11} - 10^{-13}$ meter, while for an
electron it is approximately between $10^{-13} - 10^{-15}$ meter.
