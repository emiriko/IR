Partial differential equations with discrete (concentrated) state-dependent
delays in the space of continuous functions are investigated. In general, the
corresponding initial value problem is not well posed, so we find an additional
assumption on the state-dependent delay function to guarantee the well
posedness. For the constructed dynamical system we study the long-time
asymptotic behavior and prove the existence of a compact global attractor.
