In this Letter, we present the patterning, exfoliation and micromanipulation
of thin graphitic discs which are subsequently connected and patterned into
sub-100nm wide ribbons with a resist-free process using Focused Ion Beam (FIB)
lithography and deposition. The electronic transport properties of the double
side-gated nanoribbons are then investigated down to 40 K and interpreted with
a simple model of 1D array of tunnelling junctions.
