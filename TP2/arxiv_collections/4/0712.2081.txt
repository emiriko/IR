Analyses of the inelastic $\alpha$+$^{12}$C scattering at medium energies
have indicated that the strength of the Hoyle state (the isoscalar 0$^+_2$
excitation at 7.65 MeV in $^{12}$C) seems to exhaust only 7 to 9% of the
monopole energy weighted sum rule (EWSR), compared to about 15% of the EWSR
extracted from inelastic electron scattering data. The full monopole transition
strength predicted by realistic microscopic $\alpha$-cluster models of the
Hoyle state can be shown to exhaust up to 22% of the EWSR. To explore the
missing monopole strength in the inelastic $\alpha$+$^{12}$C scattering, we
have performed a fully microscopic folding model analysis of the inelastic
$\alpha$+$^{12}$C scattering at $E_{\rm lab}=104$ to 240 MeV using the
3-$\alpha$ resonating group wave function of the Hoyle state obtained by
Kamimura, and a complex density-dependent M3Y interaction newly parametrized
based on the Brueckner Hartree Fock results for nuclear matter. Our folding
model analysis has shown consistently that the missing monopole strength of the
Hoyle state is not associated with the uncertainties in the analysis of the
$\alpha$+$^{12}$C scattering, but is most likely due to the short lifetime and
weakly bound structure of this state which significantly enhances absorption in
the exit $\alpha$+$^{12}$C$^*(0^+_2)$ channel.
