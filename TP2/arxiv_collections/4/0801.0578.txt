A discrepancy between the Anomaly Mediated Supersymmetry Breaking (AMSB)
gaugino mass calculated from the work of Kaplunovsky and Louis (hep-th/9402005)
(KL) and other calculations in the literature is explained, and it is argued
that the KL expression is the correct one relevant to the Wilsonian action.
Furthermore it is argued that the AMSB contribution to the squark and slepton
masses should be replaced by the contribution pointed out by Dine and Seiberg
(DS) which has nothing to do with Weyl anomalies. This is not in general
equivalent to the AMSB expression, and it is shown that there are models in
which the usual AMSB expression would vanish but the DS one is non-zero. In
fact the latter has aspects of both AMSB and gauge mediated SUSY breaking. In
particular like the latter, it gives positive squared masses for sleptons.
