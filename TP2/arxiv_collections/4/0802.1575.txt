A simple model is proposed for the buckling and coiling instability of a
viscous "fluid rope" falling on a plane. By regarding a fluid rope as a
one-dimensional flow, this model accounts for only the axial and shared viscous
forces. Our model successfully reproduces several experiments with no
adjustable parameters, such as the existence of three distinct coiling regimes
reported in Phys. Rev. Lett. 93, 214502 (2004). Our model allows for the
discussion of unsteady motion. An expression for the critical fall height at
which the coiling frequency changes from a decrease to increase was
phenomenologically derived. It was found that the coil-uncoil transition shows
remarkable hysteresis only for weak gravity condition.
