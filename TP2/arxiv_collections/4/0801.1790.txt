A spin transport model is employed to study the effects of spin dephasing
induced by diffusion-driven transit-time uncertainty through semiconductor
spintronic devices where drift is the dominant transport mechanism. It is found
that in the ohmic regime, dephasing is independent of transit length, and
determined primarily by voltage drop across the spin transport region. The
effects of voltage and temperature predicted by the model are compared to
experimental results from a 350-micron-thick silicon spin-transport device
using derived mathematical expressions of spin dephasing.
