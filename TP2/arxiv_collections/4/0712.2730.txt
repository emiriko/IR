We consider topological order and dimer order in several frustrated spin
ladder models, which are related to higher dimensional models of current
interest; we also address the occurrence of fractionalized phases with
deconfined spinon excitations in these models. Combining results obtained with
both analytic and numerical methods, we discuss how the occurrence of dimerized
or fractionalized phases are dictated by the system's geometry.
