We investigate the behavior of an array of Bose-Einstein condensate tubes
described by means of a Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian. Using an anisotropic
non-polynomial Schrodinger equation we link the macroscopic parameters in the
Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian to the ones that are tunable in experiments. Using a
mean field approach we predict that increasing the optical lattice strength
along the direction of the tubes, the condensate can experience a reentrant
transition between a Mott insulating phase and the superfluid one.
