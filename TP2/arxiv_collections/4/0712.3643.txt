This is a synopsis of our recent work on quantum entanglement, recoherence
and information flow between an uniformly accelerated detector and a massless
quantum scalar field. The availability of exact solutions to this model enables
us to explore the black hole information issue with some quantifiable results
and new insights. To the extent this model can be used as an analog to the
system of a black hole interacting with a quantum field, our result seems to
suggest in the prevalent non-Markovian regime, assuming unitarity for the
combined system, that black hole information is not lost but transferred to the
quantum field degrees of freedom. This combined system will evolve into a
highly entangled state between a remnant of large area (in Bekenstein's black
hole atom analog) without any information of its initial state, while the
quantum field is imbued with complex information content not-so-easily
retrievable by a local observer.
