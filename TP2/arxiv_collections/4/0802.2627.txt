The phase diagram of correlated, disordered electron systems is calculated
within dynamical mean-field theory for the Anderson-Falicov-Kimball model with
nearest-neighbors and next-nearest-neighbors hopping. The half-filled band is
analyzed in terms of the chemical potential of the system using the geometric
and arithmetic averages. We also introduce the on-site energies exhibiting a
long-range correlated disorder, which generates a system with similar
characteristics as the one created by a random independent variable
distribution. A decrease in the correlated disorder reduces the extended phase.
