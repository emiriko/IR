We exploit the quantum coherence between pair-produced D0 and D0bar in
psi(3770) decays to study charm mixing, which is characterized by the
parameters x and y, and to make a first determination of the relative strong
phase \delta between doubly Cabibbo-suppressed D0 -> K+pi- and Cabibbo-favored
D0bar -> K+pi-. We analyze a sample of 1.0 million D0D0bar pairs from 281 pb^-1
of e+e- collision data collected with the CLEO-c detector at E_cm = 3.77 GeV.
By combining CLEO-c measurements with branching fraction input and
time-integrated measurements of R_M = (x^2+y^2)/2 and R_{WS} = Gamma(D0 ->
K+pi-)/Gamma(D0bar -> K+pi-) from other experiments, we find \cos\delta = 1.03
+0.31-0.17 +- 0.06, where the uncertainties are statistical and systematic,
respectively. In addition, by further including external measurements of charm
mixing parameters, we obtain an alternate measurement of \cos\delta = 1.10 +-
0.35 +- 0.07, as well as x\sin\delta = (4.4 +2.7-1.8 +- 2.9) x 10^-3 and \delta
= 22 +11-12 +9-11 degrees.
