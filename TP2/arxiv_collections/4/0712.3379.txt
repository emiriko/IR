Theory of expectation values is presented as an alternative to S-matrix
theory for quantum fields. This change of emphasis is conditioned by a
transition from the accelerator physics to astrophysics and cosmology. The
issues discussed are the time-loop formalism, the Schwinger - Keldysh diagrams,
the effective action, the vacuum currents, and the effect of particle creation.
