We have used atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to study the
structure and dynamics of water molecules inside an open ended carbon nanotube
placed in a bath of water molecules. The size of the nanotube allows only a
single file of water molecules inside the nanotube. The water molecules inside
the nanotube show solid-like ordering at room temperature, which we quantify by
calculating the pair correlation function. It is shown that even for the
longest observation times, the mode of diffusion of the water molecules inside
the nanotube is Fickian and not sub-diffusive. We also propose a
one-dimensional random walk model for the diffusion of the water molecules
inside the nanotube. We find good agreement between the mean-square
displacements calculated from the random walk model and from MD simulations,
thereby confirming that the water molecules undergo normal-mode diffusion
inside the nanotube. We attribute this behavior to strong positional
correlations that cause all the water molecules inside the nanotube to move
collectively as a single object. The average residence time of the water
molecules inside the nanotube is shown to scale quadratically with the nanotube
length.
