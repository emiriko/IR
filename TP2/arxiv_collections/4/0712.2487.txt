We point out that the works described by Foot et al. in arXiv:0706.1829
[hep-ph] and arXiv:0709.2750 [hep-ph] are derivatives of our work described in
arXiv:hep-th/0403039, the extended version of which was published in "Standard
Model and SU(5) GUT with Local Scale Invariance and the Weylon", AIP Conf.
Proc. 881 (2007) pp. 82, Melville, New York, 2006. We are wondering how many
motions (and publications!) they will go through before finally admitting that
they have re-discovered our model, and of course, as is the usual practice
these days, claiming afterwards to the world of their independent arrival at
our model. Reference to our original work is long overdue.
