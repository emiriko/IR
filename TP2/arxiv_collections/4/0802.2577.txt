Short-message (SM) is one of the most frequently used communication channels
in the modern society. In this Brief Report, based on the SM communication
records provided by some volunteers, we investigate the statistics of SM
communication pattern, including the interevent time distributions between two
consecutive short messages and two conversations, and the distribution of
message number contained by a complete conversation. In the individual level,
the current empirical data raises a strong evidence that the human activity
pattern, exhibiting a heavy-tailed interevent time distribution, is driven by a
non-Poisson nature.
