In this paper, we present the equivalent medium theory by using the linear
response theory. It is found that, under the condition of the linear response,
a series of different media with different refractive indices $n_{i}(\omega)$
and lengths $d_{i}$ can be equivalent to an effective medium with the
volume-averaged refractive index $\frac{1}{D}\sum_{i=1}^{N}n_{i}(\omega)d_{i}$
and the total length $D=\sum_{i=1i}^{N}d_{i}$,where $N$ is the number of
different media. Based on this equivalent theory, it is a simple but very
useful method to design the effective medium with any desirable dispersion
properties. As an example, we present a proposal to obtain the enhancement or
reduction of the refractive index without absorption and the large dispersion
without obvious absorption by assembling different linear dispersive gain and
absorptive media.
