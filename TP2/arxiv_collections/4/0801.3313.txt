The parton rescattering effect on the charged hadron forward-backward
multiplicity correlation in $pp$ collisions at $\sqrt s$=200 GeV is studied by
a parton and hadron cascade model, PACIAE, based on the PYTHIA model. The
calculated multiplicity and pseudorapidity distribution of the final state
charged hadron are well compared with experimental data. It turned out that the
final state charged hadron pseudorapidity distribution are different from the
initial state charged partons. The parton rescattering effect on the charged
hadron forward-backward multiplicity correlation increases with increasing
parton rescattering strength in the center pseudorapidity region ($|\eta| <1$).
However, this effect becomes weaker in the outer pseudorapidity region
($|\eta|> 1$).
