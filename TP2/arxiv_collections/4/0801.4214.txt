In 3+1 dimensions there are anti-de quotients which are black holes with
toroidal event horizons. By analytic continuation of the Schwarzschild-anti-de
Sitter solution (and appropriate identifications) one finds two one parameter
families of spacetimes that contain these quotient black holes. One of these
families consists of B-metrics ("bubbles of nothing"), the other of black hole
spacetimes. All of them have vanishing conserved charges.
