SciBooNE is a new experiment at FNAL which will make precision
neutrino-nucleus cross section measurements in the one GeV region. These
measurements are essential for the future neutrino oscillation experiments. We
started data taking in the antineutrino mode on June 8, 2007, and collected
5.19 \times 10^{19} protons on target (POT) before the accelerator shutdown in
August. The first data from SciBooNE are reported in this article.
