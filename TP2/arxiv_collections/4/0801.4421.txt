We discuss string theory alpha' corrections in the dual description of the
expanding boost invariant N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills plasma at strong
coupling. We compute finite 't Hooft coupling corrections to the shear
viscosity and find that it disagrees with the equilibrium correlation function
computations. We comment on the possible source of the discrepancy.
