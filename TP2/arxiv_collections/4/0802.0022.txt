We present an improved method of reconstructing New Physics (NP) masses from
invariant mass endpoints. While the traditional method focuses on a single NP
decay, our method considers the decays of two or more NP particles ($ABC...$)
in a grander decay chain: $ anything \to ABC... \to ... \to jets + leptons$.
Though the center-of-mass energy $E_{CM}$ of `anything' varies unpredictably at
a hadron collider, a sample of many events nonetheless expresses features of
threshold production $E_{CM} = m_A + m_B + ...$: invariant masses constructed
from the final jet and lepton momenta are correlated in a way that makes their
threshold endpoints visually obvious in a scatterplot. We illustrate this
technique for the production of two neutralinos in the MSSM: $anything \to
\widetilde{\chi}_{i}^0 \widetilde{\chi}_{j}^0$ ($i,j=2,3,4$) which subsequently
decay via on- or off-shell sleptons to four leptons. Assuming the relevant SUSY
spectrum is below $1 TeV$ and squarks/gluinos eventually decay to neutralinos,
our MC study shows that one low-luminosity year at the LHC ($10-30 fb^{-1}$)
can quantitatively determine on- versus off-shell decays and find the relevant
neutralino and slepton masses to less than 10 percent.
