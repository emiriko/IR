Polycrystalline samples and submillimeter size single crystals of Na-doped
Ca2CuO2Cl2 have been synthesized under high pressure. A series of experiments
showed that the Na content depends not only on the pressure during the
synthesis but also on the synthesis temperature and time. From a comparison of
the Na-CCOC data with those of structurally related La214 cuprate
superconductors we concluded that chlorine at the apical site is less effective
that oxygen in supplying charge carriers to the CuO2 plans. As a result, the
coupling between the CuO2 planes is weakened, the transition temperature Tc is
reduced and the anisotropic nature is enhanced.
