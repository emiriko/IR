Time reversal of acoustic waves can be achieved efficiently by the persistent
control of excitations in a finite region of the system. The procedure, called
Time Reversal Mirror, is stable against the inhomogeneities of the medium and
it has numerous applications in medical physics, oceanography and
communications. As a first step in the study of this robustness, we apply the
Perfect Inverse Filter procedure that accounts for the memory effects of the
system. In the numerical evaluation of such procedures we developed the Pair
Partitioning method for a system of coupled oscillators. The algorithm,
inspired in the Trotter strategy for quantum dynamics, obtains the dynamic for
a chain of coupled harmonic oscillators by the separation of the system in
pairs and applying a stroboscopic sequence that alternates the evolution of
each pair. We analyze here the formal basis of the method and discuss his
extension for including energy dissipation inside the medium.
