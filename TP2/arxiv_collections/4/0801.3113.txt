This paper proposes the incremental Bayesian optimization algorithm (iBOA),
which modifies standard BOA by removing the population of solutions and using
incremental updates of the Bayesian network. iBOA is shown to be able to learn
and exploit unrestricted Bayesian networks using incremental techniques for
updating both the structure as well as the parameters of the probabilistic
model. This represents an important step toward the design of competent
incremental estimation of distribution algorithms that can solve difficult
nearly decomposable problems scalably and reliably.
