Elastic electron scattering off $^3$He and $^4$He has recently been studied
at forward and backward scattering angles in Hall A at JLab. The results will
provide accurate data on the elastic form factors, charge and magnetic for
$^3$He and charge only for $^4$He, up to squared momentum transfer $Q^2$-values
of 3.2 GeV$^2$.
