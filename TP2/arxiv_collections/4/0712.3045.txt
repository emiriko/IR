Wigner had expressed the opinion that the impossibility of exact measurements
of single operators like position operators rendered the notion of geometrical
points somewhat dubious in physics. Using Sewell's recent resolution of the
measurement problem (collapse of the wave packet) in quantum mechanics and
extending it to the measurement of operators with continuous spectra, we are
able to compare the situation in quantum mechanics with that in quantum
mechanics. Our conclusion is that the notion of a geometrical point is as
meaningful in quantum mechanics as it is in classical mechanics.
