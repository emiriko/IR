Two wildland fire models are described, one based on
reaction-diffusion-convection partial differential equations, and one based on
semi-empirical fire spread by the level let method. The level set method model
is coupled with the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) atmospheric model.
The regularized and the morphing ensemble Kalman filter are used for data
assimilation.
