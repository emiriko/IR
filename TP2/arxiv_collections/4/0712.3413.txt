In this paper we explain the biophysical principles which, according to us,
govern the Proteus mirabilis swarm phenomenon. Then, we translate this
explanation into a mathematical model, essentially based on partial
differential equations. This model is then implemented using numerical methods
of the finite volume type in order to make simulations. The simulations show
most of the characteristics which are observed in situ and in particular the
terrace generation.
