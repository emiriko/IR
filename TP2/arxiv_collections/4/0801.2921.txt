We perform a detailed study of temperature, bias and doping dependance of
interlayer transport in the layered high temperature superconductor
Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$. We observe that the shape of interlayer
characteristics in underdoped crystals exhibit a remarkable crossover at the
superconducting transition temperature: from thermal activation-type at
$T>T_c$, to almost $T-$independent quantum tunneling-type, at $T<T_c$. Our data
indicates that the interlayer transport mechanism may change with doping: from
the conventional single quasiparticle tunneling in overdoped, to a
progressively increasing Cooper pair contribution in underdoped crystals.
