A theoretical study of the variation of thermodynamic and transport
properties of calamitic liquid crystals across the isotropic-nematic phase
transition is carried out by calculating the {\it wavenumber (k) and time (t)}
dependent intermediate scattering function of the liquid, via computer
simulations of model nematogens. The objective is to understand the
experimentally observed anomalies and sharp variation in many thermodynamic and
transport properties, namely specific heat $C$, sound attenuation coefficient
$\Gamma$, thermal diffusivity $D_T$ and sound velocity $c_s$ are as the I-N
transition is approached from the isotropic side. The small wavelength limit of
the calculated intermediate scattering function $F(k,t)$ is used to obtain the
ratio of specific heats $\gamma$ and other properties mentioned above. We find
that all of them show non-monotonic variations near the I-N transition, with
$\Gamma$ showing a cusp-like behavior. We suggest that the observed anomalous
features are a direct consequence of the existence of pseudo-nematic domains in
the system near the phase boundary and the melting and formation of such
domains give rise to sound attenuation and also to the observed specific heat
anomaly. A theoretical description of these anomalies should invoke
translation-rotation coupling at molecular level. While the heterogeneous
dynamics observed here bear resemblance to that in deeply supercooled liquids
near glass transition, the thermodynamic anomalies articulated here are largely
absent in supercooled liquids.
