We present a new approach for reasoning about liveness properties of
distributed systems, represented as automata. Our approach is based on
simulation relations, and requires reasoning only over finite execution
fragments. Current simulation-relation based methods for reasoning about
liveness properties of automata require reasoning over entire executions, since
they involve a proof obligation of the form: if a concrete and abstract
execution ``correspond'' via the simulation, and the concrete execution is
live, then so is the abstract execution.
  Our contribution consists of (1) a formalism for defining liveness
properties, (2) a proof method for liveness properties based on that formalism,
and (3) two expressive completeness results: firstly, our formalism can express
any liveness property which satisfies a natural ``robustness'' condition, and
secondly, our formalism can express any liveness property at all, provided that
history variables can be used
