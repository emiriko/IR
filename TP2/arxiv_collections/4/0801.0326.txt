The loop quantum theory, which constitutes a very small discontinuous space,
as new method is applied to biology. The model of protein folding and lungs is
proposed. In the model, some known results are used, and four approximate
conclusions are obtained: their structures are quantized, their space regions
are finite, various singularities correspond to folding and crossed points, and
different types of catastrophe exist. Further, based on the inseparability and
correlativity of the biological systems, the nonlinear whole biology is
proposed, and four basic hypotheses are formed. It may unify reductionism and
holism, structuralism and functionalism. Finally, the medical meaning of the
theory is discussed briefly.
