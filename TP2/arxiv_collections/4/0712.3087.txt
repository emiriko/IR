We develop the real stabilization method within the framework of the
relativistic mean field (RMF) model. With the self-consistent nuclear
potentials from the RMF model, the real stabilization method is used to study
single-particle resonant states in spherical nuclei. As examples, the energies,
widths and wave functions of low-lying neutron resonant states in $^{120}$Sn
are obtained. These results are compared with those from the scattering phase
shift method and the analytic continuation in the coupling constant approach
and satisfactory agreements are found.
