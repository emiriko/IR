A fitting scheme is proposed to obtain effective potentials from
Car-Parrinello molecular dynamics (CPMD) simulations. It is used to
parameterize a new pair potential for silica. MD simulations with this new
potential are done to determine structural and dynamic properties and to
compare these properties to those obtained from CPMD and a MD simulation using
the so-called BKS potential. The new potential reproduces accurately the liquid
structure generated by the CPMD trajectories, the experimental activation
energies for the self-diffusion constants and the experimental density of
amorphous silica. Also lattice parameters and elastic constants of alpha-quartz
are well-reproduced, showing the transferability of the new potential.
