Assemblies of allosteric proteins, nano-scale Brownian computers, are the
principle information processing devices in biology. The troponin C-troponin I
(TnC-TnI) complex, the Ca$^{2+}$-sensitive regulatory switch of the heart, is a
paradigm for Brownian computation. TnC and TnI specialize in sensing (reading)
and reporting (writing) tasks of computation. We have examined this complex
using a newly developed phenomenological model of allostery.
Nearest-neighbor-limited interactions among members of the assembly place
previously unrecognized constrains the topology of the system's free energy
landscape and generate degenerate transition probabilities. As a result,
signaling fidelity and deactivation kinetics can not be simultaneously
optimized. This trade-off places an upper limit on the rate of information
processing by assemblies of allosteric proteins that couple to a single ligand
chemical bath.
