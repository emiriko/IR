This extensive review was written for the ``Encyclopedia of Complexity and
System Science'' (Springer, 2008) and addresses a broad audience ranging from
engineers to applied mathematicians, computer scientists and physicists. It
provides an extensive overview of various aspects of pedestrian dynamics,
focussing on evacuation processes. First the current status of empirical
results is critically reviewed as it forms the basis for the calibration of
models needed for quantitative predictions. Then various modeling approaches
are discussed, focussing on cellular automata models. Finally, some specific
applications to safety analysis in public buildings or public transport are
presented.
