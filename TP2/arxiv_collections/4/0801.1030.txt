In this paper vibration combined high temperature cycle tests for packaged
capacitive SOI-MEMS accelerometers are presented. The aim of these tests is to
provide useful Design for Reliability information for MEMS designers. A high
temperature test chamber and a chopper-stabilized read-out circuitry were
designed and realized at BME - DED. Twenty thermal cycles of combined
Temperature Cycle Test and Fatigue Vibration Test has been carried out on 5
samples. Statistical evaluation of the test results showed that degradation has
started in 3 out of the 5 samples.
