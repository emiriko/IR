The non-linear coupled Gross-Pitaevskii equation governing the dynamics of
the two component Bose-Einstein condensate (TBEC) is shown to admit pure
sinusoidal, propagating wave solutions in quasi one dimensional geometry. These
solutions, which exist for a wide parameter range, are then investigated in the
presence of a harmonic oscillator trap with time dependent scattering length.
This illustrates the procedure for coherent control of these modes through
temporal modulation of the parameters, like scattering length and oscillator
frequency. We subsequently analyzed this system in an optical lattice, where
the occurrence of an irreversible phase transition from superfluid to insulator
phase is seen.
