We present a systematic study of the variations of the ^{7}Li NMR properties
versus magnetic defect concentration up to 0.83 mol% within the spinel
structure of polycrystalline powder samples and a collection of small single
crystals of LiV2O4 in the temperature range from 0.5 to 4.2 K. We also report
static magnetization measurements and ac magnetic susceptibility measurements
at 14 MHz on the samples at low temperatures. Both the NMR spectrum and nuclear
spin-lattice relaxation rate are inhomogeneous in the presence of the magnetic
defects. The NMR data for the powders are well explained by assuming that (i)
there is a random distribution of magnetic point defects, (ii) the same heavy
Fermi liquid is present in the samples containing the magnetic defects as in
magnetically pure LiV2O4, and (iii) the influences of the magnetic defects and
of the Fermi liquid on the magnetization and NMR properties are separable. In
the single crystals, somewhat different behaviors are observed. Remarkably, the
magnetic defects in the powder samples show evidence of spin freezing below T ~
1.0 K, whereas in the single crystals with similar magnetic defect
concentration no spin freezing was found down to 0.5 K. Thus different types of
magnetic defects and/or interactions between them appear to arise in the
powders versus the crystals, possibly due to the substantially different
synthesis conditions of the powders and crystals.
