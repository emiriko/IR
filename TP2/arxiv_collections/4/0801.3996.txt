In this paper the Landscape potential is considered as an environment for
system: trajectory-environment (TE). The trajectory is generating a measure on
the landscape. The entropy of this dynamic measure is a power factor for
trajectory. This dynamics leads to a memory appearance and produces a
non-singular measure practically independently from initial conditions. It is
shown that measure is dual to the metrics and its evolution may be considered
as the landscape deformations: production-destruction of attractors-vacua. It
seems like the renormalization process with phase transitions: renormgroup
quantization. It is shown what the entropy of this global landscape measure
acts on the trajectory alike a dark energy.
