We consider the action of the Bethe algebra B_K on (\otimes_{s=1}^k
L_{\lambda^{(s)}})_\lambda, the weight subspace of weight $\lambda$ of the
tensor product of k polynomial irreducible gl_N-modules with highest weights
\lambda^{(1)},...,\lambda^{(k)}, respectively. The Bethe algebra depends on N
complex numbers K=(K_1,...,K_N). Under the assumption that K_1,...,K_N are
distinct, we prove that the image of B_K in the endomorphisms of
(\otimes_{s=1}^k L_{\lambda^{(s)}})_\lambda is isomorphic to the algebra of
functions on the intersection of k suitable Schubert cycles in the Grassmannian
of N-dimensional spaces of quasi-exponentials with exponents K. We also prove
that the B_K-module (\otimes_{s=1}^k L_{\lambda^{(s)}})_\lambda is isomorphic
to the coregular representation of that algebra of functions. We present a
Bethe ansatz construction identifying the eigenvectors of the Bethe algebra
with points of that intersection of Schubert cycles.
