We present the first detailed, large-scale study of the Minimal
Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) at a $\sqrt s=500$ GeV International
Linear Collider, including full Standard Model backgrounds and detector
simulation. We investigate 242 points in the MSSM parameter space, which we
term models, that have been shown by Arkani-Hamed et al to be difficult to
study at the LHC. In fact, these points in MSSM parameter space correspond to
162 pairs of models which give indistinguishable signatures at the LHC, giving
rise to the so-called LHC Inverse Problem. We first determine whether the
production of the various SUSY particles is visible above the Standard Model
background for each of these parameter space points, and then make a detailed
comparison of their various signatures. Assuming an integrated luminosity of
500 fb$^{-1}$, we find that only 82 out of 242 models lead to visible
signatures of some kind with a significance $\geq 5$ and that only 57(63) out
of the 162 model pairs are distinguishable at $5(3)\sigma$. Our analysis
includes PYTHIA and CompHEP SUSY signal generation, full matrix element SM
backgrounds for all $2\to 2, 2\to 4$, and $2\to 6$ processes, ISR and
beamstrahlung generated via WHIZARD/GuineaPig, and employs the fast SiD
detector simulation org.lcsim.
