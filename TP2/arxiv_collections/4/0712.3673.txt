We demonstrate that the harmonic inversion technique is a powerful tool to
analyze the spectral properties of optical microcavities. As an interesting
example we study the statistical properties of complex frequencies of the fully
chaotic microstadium. We show that the conjectured fractal Weyl law for open
chaotic systems [W. T. Lu, S. Sridhar, and M. Zworski, Phys. Rev. Lett. 91,
154101 (2003)] is valid for dielectric microcavities only if the concept of the
chaotic repeller is extended to a multifractal by incorporating Fresnel's laws.
