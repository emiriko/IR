We show connections between a special type of addition formulas and a theorem
of Stieltjes and Rogers. We use different techniques to derive the desirable
addition formulas. We apply our approach to derive special addition theorems
for Bessel functions and confluent hypergeometric functions. We also derive
several additions theorems for basic hypergeometric functions. Applications to
the evaluation of Hankel determinants are also given .
