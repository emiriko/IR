The notion of a local line bundle on a manifold, classified by 2-cohomology
with real coefficients, is introduced. The twisting of pseudodifferential
operators by such a line bundle leads to an algebroid with elliptic elements
with real-valued index, given by a twisted variant of the Atiyah-Singer index
formula. Using ideas of Boutet de Monvel and Guillemin the corresponding
twisted Toeplitz algebroid on any compact symplectic manifold is shown to yield
the star products of Lecomte and DeWilde ([MR84g:17014]) see also Fedosov's
construction in [MR92k:58267]. This also shows that the trace on the star
algebra is identified with the residue trace of Wodzicki and Guillemin
