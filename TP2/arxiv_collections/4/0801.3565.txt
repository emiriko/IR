We analyze the antiferromagnetic $\text{SU}(3)$ Heisenberg chain by means of
the Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG). The results confirm that the
model is critical and the computation of its central charge and the scaling
dimensions of the first excited states show that the underlying low energy
conformal field theory is the $\text{SU}(3)_1$ Wess-Zumino-Novikov-Witten
model.
