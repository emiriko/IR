Computational modelling with multi-agent systems is becoming an important
technique of studying language evolution. We present a brief introduction into
this rapidly developing field, as well as our own contributions that include an
analysis of the evolutionary naming-game model. In this model communicating
agents, that try to establish a common vocabulary, are equipped with an
evolutionarily selected learning ability. Such a coupling of biological and
linguistic ingredients results in an abrupt transition: upon a small change of
the model control parameter a poorly communicating group of linguistically
unskilled agents transforms into almost perfectly communicating group with
large learning abilities. Genetic imprinting of the learning abilities proceeds
via Baldwin effect: initially unskilled communicating agents learn a language
and that creates a niche in which there is an evolutionary pressure for the
increase of learning ability. Under the assumption that communication intensity
increases continuously with finite speed, the transition is split into several
transition-like changes. It shows that the speed of cultural changes, that sets
an additional characteristic timescale, might be yet another factor affecting
the evolution of language. In our opinion, this model shows that linguistic and
biological processes have a strong influence on each other and this effect
certainly has contributed to an explosive development of our species.
