We demonstrate polarization-entanglement for non-degenerate and degenerate
photon-pairs generated through Kerr-nonlinearity in a nano-scale
silicon-on-insulator(SOI) waveguide. We use a compact counter propagating
configuration to create two-photon polarization-entangled state, |H>|H> +
|V>|V>. We observe two-photon interference with visibility > 91% and > 80% for
non-degenerate and degenerate photon-pairs, respectively. The experimental
structure can be implemented on optical chips as an integrated source of
entangled photons for future quantum computer and communication applications.
