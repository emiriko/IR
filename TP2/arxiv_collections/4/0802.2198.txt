In this paper, we propose a new framework for quantum field theory in terms
of consistency conditions. The consistency conditions that we consider are
"associativity" or "factorization" conditions on the operator product expansion
(OPE) of the theory, and are proposed to be the defining property of any
quantum field theory. Our framework is presented in the Euclidean setting, and
is applicable in principle to any quantum field theory, including non-conformal
ones. In our framework, we obtain a characterization of perturbations of a
given quantum field theory in terms of a certain cohomology ring of
Hochschild-type. We illustrate our framework by the free field, but our
constructions are general and apply also to interacting quantum field theories.
For such theories, we propose a new scheme to construct the OPE which is based
on the use of non-linear quantized field equations.
