Dirac leptogenesis, in which neutrinos are purely Dirac and develop small but
nonzero effective masses without the aid of the see-saw mechanism, provides an
interesting alternative to the standard leptogenesis picture. Here we review
the theory and phenomenology of Dirac leptogenesis and show that it is a viable
theory capable of simultaneously satisfying all relevant bounds from cosmology,
neutrino physics, and flavor violation. In addition, we also explore several
potential extensions of the model, such as the possibility of right-handed
sneutrino dark matter and the potential for relating the leptogenesis mechanism
to the origin of the mu-term. Theories with a heavy gravitino and gaugino
masses generated by anomaly mediation emerge as one natural context for Dirac
leptogenesis. In such models the lightest neutralino is often expected to be
predominately wino or Higgsino, and is a viable dark matter candidate. We
conclude with an examination of the prospects for detecting the effectively
monoenergetic photon signal that results from the annihilation of such a dark
matter particle in the galactic halo.
