One of the more profound mysteries of physics is how nature ties together EM
fields to form an electron. A way to do this is examined in this study. A bare
magnetic dipole containing a flux quantum spins stably, and produces an inverse
square E= -vxB electric field similar to what one finds from charge. Gauss' law
finds charge in this model, though there be none. For stability, a current loop
about the waist of the magnetic dipole is needed and we must go beyond the
classical Maxwell's equations to find it. A spinning E field is equivalent to
an electric displacement current. The sideways motion of the spinning E (of
constant magnitude) creates a little-recognized transverse electric
displacement current about the waist. This differs from Maxwell's electric
displacement current, in which E increases in magnitude. The sideways motion of
E supports the dipolar B field, B=vxE/c^2. Beyond the very core of the magnetic
dipole, each of these two velocities is essentially c and vxE/c^2 =
vx(-vxB)/c^2 = B, the spinning E field wholly sourcing the dipolar B field. The
anisotropy of the vxB field is cured by precession about an inclined axis.
Choosing a Bohr magneton for the magnetic dipole and assuming it spins at the
Compton frequency, Gauss' law finds Q = e. The vxB field, normally thought to
be solenoidal, becomes instead a conservative field in this model. Charge is
recognized as merely a mathematical construct, not fundamental but nevertheless
useful. With charge deleted, and with addition of the transverse electric
displacement current, Maxwell's equations can be written in terms of the E and
B fields alone.
