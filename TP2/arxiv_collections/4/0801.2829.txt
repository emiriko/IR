Spin-polarized transport through a band-gap-matched ZnSe/Zn_{1-x}Mn_{x}
Se/ZnSe/Zn_{1-x}Mn_{x}Se/ZnSe multilayer structure is investigated. The
resonant transport is shown to occur at different energies for different spins
owing to the split of spin subbands in the paramagnetic layers. It is found
that the polarization of current density can be reversed in a certain range of
magnetic field, with the peak of polarization moving towards a stronger
magnetic field for increasing the width of central ZnSe layer while shifting
towards an opposite direction for increasing the width of paramagnetic layer.
The reversal is limited in a small-size system. A strong suppression of the
spin up component of the current density is present at high magnetic field. It
is expected that such a reversal of the polarization could act as a possible
mechanism for a selective spin filter device.
