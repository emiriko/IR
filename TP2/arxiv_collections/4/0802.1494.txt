We describe a three-dimensional geometry that exhibits a repulsive Casimir
force using ordinary metallic materials, as computed via an exact numerical
method (no uncontrolled approximations). The geometry consists of a zippelike,
glide-symmetric structure formed of interleaved metal brackets attached to
parallel plates. Depending on the separation, the perpendicular force between
the plates/brackets varies from attractive (large separations) to repulsive
(intermediate distances) and back to attractive (close separations), with one
point of stable equilibrium in the perpendicular direction. This geometry was
motivated by a simple intuition of attractive interactions between surfaces,
and so we also consider how a rough proximity force approximation of pairwise
attractions compares to the exact calculations.
