We present an introduction to the basic concepts of electroweak symmetry
breaking and Higgs physics within the Standard Model and its supersymmetric
extensions. A brief overview will also be given on alternative mechanisms of
electroweak symmetry breaking. In addition to the theoretical basis, the
present experimental status of Higgs physics and prospects at the Tevatron, the
LHC and e+e- linear colliders are discussed.
