Isotope shifts in dielectronic recombination spectra were studied for Li-like
^{A}Nd^{57+} ions with A=142 and A=150. From the displacement of resonance
positions energy shifts \delta E^{142,150}(2s-2p_1/2)= 40.2(3)(6) meV
(stat)(sys)) and \delta E^{142,150}(2s-2p_3/2) = 42.3(12)(20) meV of 2s-2p_j
transitions were deduced. An evaluation of these values within a full QED
treatment yields a change in the mean-square charge radius of ^{142,150}\delta
<r^2> = -1.36(1)(3) fm^2. The approach is conceptually new and combines the
advantage of a simple atomic structure with high sensitivity to nuclear size.
