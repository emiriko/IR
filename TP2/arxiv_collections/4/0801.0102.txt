Huffman coding finds an optimal prefix code for a given probability mass
function. Consider situations in which one wishes to find an optimal code with
the restriction that all codewords have lengths that lie in a user-specified
set of lengths (or, equivalently, no codewords have lengths that lie in a
complementary set). This paper introduces a polynomial-time dynamic programming
algorithm that finds optimal codes for this reserved-length prefix coding
problem. This has applications to quickly encoding and decoding lossless codes.
In addition, one modification of the approach solves any quasiarithmetic prefix
coding problem, while another finds optimal codes restricted to the set of
codes with g codeword lengths for user-specified g (e.g., g=2).
