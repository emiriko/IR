LIGO observatories in Livingston, LA and Hanford, WA may detect gravitational
waves emitted from coalescing binary systems composed of two compact objects.
In order to detect compact binary coalescence (CBC) events, LIGO searches
utilize matched filtering techniques. Matched filtering is the optimal
detection strategy for stationary, Gaussian noise, however, LIGO noise is often
non-stationary, non-Gaussian. Non-stationary noise result in an excess of false
candidate events, commonly known as false alarms. This thesis develops the r^2
test to reduce the false alarm rate for LIGO CBC searches. Results of the
search for primordial black hole binary systems (where each object has less
than 1M_solar), in LIGO's Third Science Run (S3) is also presented.
  Results of the r^2 test are shown for several LIGO CBC searches, including
the binary neutron star searches in the Third and Fourth Science Runs (S3/S4),
the S3/S4 primordial black hole searches, and the binary black hole search in
the first three months of the Fifth Science Run (S5). The r^2 test
significantly reduces the false alarm rate in these searches, while only
falsely dismissing a small fraction of simulated events.
