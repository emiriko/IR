We present a theoretical analysis of the proximity effect at a
graphene-superconductor interface. We use a tight-binding model for the
electronic states in this system which allows to describe the interface at the
microscopic level. Two different interface models are proposed: one in which
the superconductor induces a finite pairing in the graphene regions underneath,
thus maintaining the honeycomb structure at the interface and one that assumes
that the graphene layer is directly coupled to a bulk superconducting
electrode. We show that properties like the Andreev reflection probability and
its channel decomposition depend critically on the model used to describe the
interface. We also study the proximity effect on the local density of states on
the graphene. For finite layers we analyze the induced minigap and how it is
reduced when the length of the layer increases. Results for the local density
of states profiles for finite and semi-infinite layers are presented.
