Atom reflection is studied in the presence of a non-Abelian vector potential
proportional to a spin-1/2 operator. The potential is produced by a relatively
simple laser configuration for atoms with a tripod level scheme. We show that
the atomic motion is described by two different dispersion branches with
positive or negative chirality. As a consequence of that, atom reflection shows
unusual features, since an incident wave may split into two reflected ones at a
barrier, an ordinary specular reflection, and an additional non-specular one.
Remarkably, the latter wave can exhibit negative reflection and may become
evanescent if the angle of incidence exceeds a critical value. These reflection
properties are crucial for future designs in non-Abelian atom optics.
