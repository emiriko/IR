Using the superfield approach we construct the $n=2$ supersymmetric
lagrangian for the FRW Universe with barotropic perfect fluid as matter field.
The obtained supersymmetric algebra allowed us to take the square root of the
Wheeler-DeWitt equation and solve the corresponding quantum constraint. This
model leads to the relation between the vacuum energy density and the energy
density of the dust matter.
