We define analogues of Verma modules for finite W-algebras. By the usual
ideas of highest weight theory, this is a first step towards the classification
of finite dimensional irreducible modules. Motivated by known results in type
A, we then formulate some precise conjectures in the case of nilpotent orbits
of standard Levi type.
