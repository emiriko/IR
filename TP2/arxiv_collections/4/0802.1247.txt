Heavy electrons in superconducting materials are widely studied with the
Kondo lattice t-J model. Numerical results have shown that the Fermi surface of
these correlated particles undergoes a flattening effect according to the
coupling degree J. This behaviour is not easy to understand from the
theoretical point of view within standard Fermi-Dirac statistics and
non-standard theories such as fractional exclusion statistics for anyons and
Tsallis nonextensive statistics. The present work is an attempt to account for
the heavy electron distribution within incomplete statistics (IS) which is
developed for complex systems with interactions which make the statistics
incomplete such that sum_i p_i^q=1. The parameter q, when different from unity,
characterizes the incompleteness of the statistics. It is shown that the
correlated electrons can be described with the help of IS with q related to the
coupling constant J in the context of Kondo model
