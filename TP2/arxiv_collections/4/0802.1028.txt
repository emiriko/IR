We study the phase transition between survival and extinction in an epidemic
process with long-range interactions and immunization. This model can be viewed
as the well-known general epidemic process (GEP) in which nearest-neighbor
interactions are replaced by Levy flights over distances r which are
distributed as P(r) ~ r^(-d-sigma). By extensive numerical simulations we
confirm previous field-theoretical results obtained by Janssen et al. [Eur.
Phys. J. B7, 137 (1999)].
