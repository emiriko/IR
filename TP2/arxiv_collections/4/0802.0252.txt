In this paper, a new implementation of the adaptation of Kohonen
self-organising maps (SOM) to dissimilarity matrices is proposed. This
implementation relies on the branch and bound principle to reduce the algorithm
running time. An important property of this new approach is that the obtained
algorithm produces exactly the same results as the standard algorithm.
