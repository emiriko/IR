Using bosonization-fermionization transformation we map the
Tomonaga-Luttinger model of spinless fermions with non-linear dispersion on the
model of fermionic quasiparticles whose interaction is irrelevant in the
renormalization group sense. Such mapping allows us to set up an expansion for
the density-density propagator of the original Tomonaga-Luttinger Hamiltonian
in orders of the (irrelevant) quasiparticle interaction. The lowest order term
in such an expansion is proportional to the propagator for free fermions. The
next term is also evaluated. The propagator found is used for calculation of
the Coulomb drug resistivity $r$ in a system of two capacitively coupled
one-dimensional conductors. It is shown that $r$ is proportional to $T^2$ for
both free and interacting fermions. The marginal repulsive in-chain interaction
acts to reduce $r$ as compared to the non-interacting result. The correction to
$r$ due to the quasiparticle interaction is found as well. It scales as $T^4$
at low temperature.
