It is shown that if a space-time has non-compact Cauchy surface, then its
topological, differentiable, and causal structure are completely determined by
a class of compact subsets of its Cauchy surface. Since causal structure
determines its topological, differentiable, and conformal structure of
space-time, this gives a natural way to encode the corresponding structures
into its Cauchy surface.
