Pressure solution creep rates and interface structures have been measured by
two methods on calcite single crystals. In the first kind of experiments,
calcite monocrystals were indented at 40 degrees C for six weeks using ceramic
indenters under stresses in the 50-200 MPa range in a saturated solution of
calcite and in a calcite-saturated aqueous solution of NH4Cl. The deformation
(depth of the hole below the indenter) is measured ex-situ at the end of the
experiment. In the second type of experiment, calcite monocrystals were
indented by spherical glass indenters for 200 hours under stresses in the 0-100
MPa range at room temperature in a saturated aqueous solution of calcite. The
displacement of the indenter was continuously recorded using a specially
constructed differential dilatometer. The experiments conducted in a
calcite-saturated aqueous solution of NH4Cl show an enhanced indentation rate
owing to the fairly high solubility of calcite in this solution. In contrast,
the experiments conducted in a calcite-saturated aqueous solution show moderate
indentation rate and the dry control experiments did not show any measurable
deformation. The rate of calcite indentation is found to be inversely
proportional to the indenter diameter, thus indicating that the process is
diffusion-controlled. The microcracks in the dissolution region under the
indenter dramatically enhance the rate of calcite indentation by a significant
reduction of the distance of solute transport in the trapped fluid phase. This
result indicates that care should be taken in extrapolating the kinetic data of
pressure solution creep from one mineral to another.
