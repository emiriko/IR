Finsler geometry has been recently re-discovered as an interesting
possibility to describe spacetime geometry beyond Riemannian geometry. The most
evident effect of this class of models is the prediction of modified dispersion
relations for particles moving in such backgrounds. In this paper, we are going
to consider the effects of modified dispersion relations on a gauge field
theory with spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) associated to a Higgs field.
The percolation of higher dimensional, Lorentz violating operators to lower
dimensional ones is discussed. We also discuss the issue of SSB in a
mono-metric Finsler scenario like the one associated to the so-called very
special relativity.
