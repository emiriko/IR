In this text we investigate the good behaviour of the elementary obstruction,
introduced by Colliot-Thelene and Sansuc. This is an obstruction to the
existence of a rational points on certain algebraic varieties. Assuming some
conditions on the Picard group, we prove that the elementary obstruction
behaves well under the Weil restriction of a variety.
