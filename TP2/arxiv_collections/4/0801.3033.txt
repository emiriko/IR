The study deals with a rotor-stator contact inducing vibration in rotating
machinery. A numerical rotor-stator system, including a non-linear bearing with
Hertz contact and clearance is considered. To determine the non-linear
responses of this system, non-linear dynamic equations can be integrated
numerically. However, this procedure is both time consuming and costly to
perform. The aim of this Note is to apply the Alternate Frequency/Time Method
and the 'path following continuation' in order to obtain the non-linear
responses to this problem. Then the orbits of rotor and stator responses at
various speeds are investigated.
