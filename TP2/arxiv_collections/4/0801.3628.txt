We propose a general method for simplifying master equations by eliminating
from the description rapidly evolving states. The physical recipe we impose is
the suppression of these states and a renormalization of the rates of all the
surviving states. In some cases, this decimation procedure can be analytically
carried out and is consistent with other analytical approaches, like in the
problem of the random walk in a double-well potential. We discuss the
application of our method to nontrivial examples: diffusion in a lattice with
defects and a model of an enzymatic reaction outside the steady state regime.
