We proposed a gravitation theory based on an analogy with electrodynamics on
the basis of a vector field. For the first time, to calculate the basic
gravitational effects in the framework of a vector theory of gravity, we use a
Lagrangian written with gravitational radiation neglected and generalized to
the case of ultra-relativistic speeds. This allows us to accurately calculate
the values of all three major gravity experiments: the values of the perihelion
shift of Mercury, the light deflection angle in the gravity field of the Sun
and the value of radar echo delay. The calculated values coincide with the
observed ones. It is shown that, in this theory, there exists a model of an
expanding Universe.
