We extract the early parton momentum distribution using the STAR
Collaboration data of ridge particles associated with a near-side jet in
central AuAu collisions at \sqrt{s_{NN}}=200 GeV. The ridge particles are
identified as medium partons kicked by the jet near the surface and they carry
direct information on the parton momentum distribution at the moment of
jet-parton collisions. The extracted parton momentum distribution has a
thermal-like transverse momentum distribution but a rapidity plateau structure
with a relatively flat rapidity distribution at mid-rapidities with sharp
kinematic boundaries at large rapidities that depend on the transverse
momentum.
