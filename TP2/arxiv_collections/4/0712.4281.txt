Work published in Sky and Telescope in 2004 discusses Galileo's observations
of the star Mizar. These observations raise questions regarding Galileo's
assumptions about the universe and the conclusions he drew from his
observations. Galileo would have expected Mizar to reveal annual parallax and
thus provide evidence of Earth's motion, but Mizar shows no such parallax.
