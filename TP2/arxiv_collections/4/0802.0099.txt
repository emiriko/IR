We discuss the fundamemtal constants in the Standard Model of particle
physics, in particular possible changes of these constants on the cosmological
time scale. The Grand Unification of the observed strong, electromagnetic and
weak interactions implies relations between time variation of the finestructure
constant alpha and the QCD scale $\Lambda_c$. The astrophysical observation of
a variation implies a time variation of $10^{-15} / year$. Several experiments
in Quantum Optics, which were designed to look for a time variation of
$\Lambda_c$, are discussed.
