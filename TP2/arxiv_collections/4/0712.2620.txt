In a recent note (arXiv:0711.4930[hep-th]) Ito and Seiler claim that there is
a 'missing link' in the derivation in arXiv:0707.2179[hep-th] by the present
author; namely, that no proof of a certain inequality used there is given at
weak coupling. Here it is pointed out that in fact no such missing link is
present. The argument in 0707.2179 is, among other things, specifically
constructed so that the inequality in question is invoked {\it only} at strong
coupling, where it is easily proven. Underlying the mangling of the argument in
0707.2179 by Ito and Seiler are their incorrect statements concerning the
dependence of the potential-moving decimation procedures used in 0707.2179 on
space-time dimensionality and other decimation parameters.
