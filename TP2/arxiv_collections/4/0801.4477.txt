A cosmological time variable is emerged from the hamiltonian formulation of
unimodular theory of gravity to measure the evolution of dynamical observables
in the theory. A set of constants of motion has been identified for the theory
on the null hypersurfaces that its evolution is with respect to the volume
clock introduced by the cosmological time variable.
