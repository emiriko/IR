We show that in the framework of the 3-3-1 model with right-handed neutrinos,
small neutrino masses and large lepton flavor violating processes such as \mu
\to 3e and \mu \to e\gamma can be obtained by just introducing an additional
Higgs sextet. In the limit of vanishing of the Yukawa interaction among Higgs
and lepton triplets (h^\nu = 0), the decay \mu \to 3e strongly depends on the
neutrino mass patterns, but the \mu \to e\gamma almost does not. The neutrino
masses are not constrained by such processes in the cases of h^\nu \neq 0.
