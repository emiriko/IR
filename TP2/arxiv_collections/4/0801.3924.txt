In this paper we discuss the impact of open source on both the security and
transparency of a software system. We focus on the more technical aspects of
this issue, combining and extending arguments developed over the years. We
stress that our discussion of the problem only applies to software for general
purpose computing systems. For embedded systems, where the software usually
cannot easily be patched or upgraded, different considerations may apply.
