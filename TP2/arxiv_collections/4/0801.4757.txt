A modified version of Young's experiment by Shahriar Afshar indirectly
reveals the presence of a fully articulated interference pattern prior to the
post-selection of a particle in a "which-slit" basis. While this experiment
does not constitute a violation of Bohr's Complementarity Principle as claimed
by Afshar, both he and many of his critics incorrectly assume that a commonly
used relationship between visibility parameter V and "which-way" parameter K
has crucial relevance to his experiment. It is argued here that this
relationship does not apply to this experimental situation and that it is wrong
to make any use of it in support of claims for or against the bearing of this
experiment on Complementarity.
