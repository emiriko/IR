Using the Gaussian-03 for ab initio calculations, we have studied interaction
of different acid molecules with a single water molecule. The molecular and
supermolecular optimized structures were found with the Becke-3-Lee-Yang-Parr
(B3LYP-hybrid potential) calculations of density-functional theory (DFT)
methods as well as the Moeller-Plesset second-order perturbation theory, using
the basis set of Aug-cc-pVDZ quality and the CRENBL ECP effective core
potential for molecules containing heavy iodine atom. Possible isomers of
studied acids and supermolecules, consisting of acid molecules coupled with a
single water molecule, are shown. Energies, zero-point energies (ZPEs), thermal
enthalpies and free energies, as well as the corresponding binding energies for
the theoretical methods were calculated. It was found that optimized structures
of supermolecular isomers with lowest energies corresponding to the global
minimum on the potential energy surfaces can be different for both theories.
The simplest structure acids H2S and H2Se, forming acid-water supermolecules,
can give clear evidence of disagreement of the two theoretical methods
concerning optimization of lowest energy structures, because the B3LYP-DFT
method gives the lowest-energy structure for the first supermolecular isomer,
but the MP2 method for the second possible isomer. A dramatic difference
between potential energy surfaces for both theories applying to the optimized
structure finding of the H2SO3-H2O supermolecular isomers was found, because
MP2 supermolecular geometries cannot exist for the corresponding B3LYP-DFT
ones, for which the frequency characteristics of the supermolecular isomers
were also calculated. In general, the binding energies and ZPE ones for the MP2
method are 10-15% larger than those for the B3LYP-DFT method.
