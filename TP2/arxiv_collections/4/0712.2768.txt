Colloids dispersed in a non-polar solvent become charged when reverse
micelles are added. We study the charge of individual sterically-stabilized
poly(methyl methacrylate) spheres dispersed in micellar solutions of the
surfactants sodium bis(2-ethyl 1-hexyl) sulfosuccinate [AOT], zirconyl 2-ethyl
hexanoate [Zr(Oct)$_{2}$], and a copolymer of poly(12-hydroxystearic
acid)--poly(methyl methacrylate) [PHSA-PMMA]. Although the sign of the particle
charge is positive for Zr(Oct)$_{2}$, negative for AOT, and essentially neutral
for PHSA-PMMA the different micellar systems display a number of common
features. In particular, we demonstrate that, over a wide range of
concentrations, the colloid charge is independent of the number of micelles
added and scales linearly with the colloid size. A simple thermodynamic model,
in which the particle charge is generated by the competitive adsorption of both
positive and negative micelles, is in good agreement with the experimental
data.
