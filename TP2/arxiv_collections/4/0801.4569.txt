We present a new analysis of two-jet event shape distributions in soft
collinear effective theory. Extending previous results, we observe that a large
class of such distributions can be expressed in terms of vacuum matrix elements
of operators in the effective theory. We match these matrix elements to the
full theory in the two-jet limit without assuming factorization of the complete
set of hadronic final states into independent sums over partonic collinear and
soft states. We also briefly discuss the relationship of this approach to
diagrammatic factorization in the full theory.
