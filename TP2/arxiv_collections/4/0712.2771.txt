We investigate the use of Kelly's strategy in the construction of an optimal
portfolio of assets. For lognormally distributed asset returns, we derive
approximate analytical results for the optimal investment fractions in various
settings. We show that when mean returns and volatilities of the assets are
small and there is no risk-free asset, the Kelly-optimal portfolio lies on
Markowitz Efficient Frontier. Since in the investigated case the Kelly approach
forbids short positions and borrowing, often only a small fraction of the
available assets is included in the Kelly-optimal portfolio. This phenomenon,
that we call condensation, is studied analytically in various model scenarios.
