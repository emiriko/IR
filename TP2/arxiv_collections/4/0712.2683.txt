The semi-classical Bloch-Boltzmann theory is at the heart of our
understanding of conduction in solids, ranging from metals to semi-conductors.
Physical systems that are beyond the range of applicability of this theory are
thus of fundamental interest. It appears that in quasicrystals and related
complex metallic alloys, a new type of break-down of this theory operates. This
phenomenon is related to the specific propagation of electrons. We develop a
theory of quantum transport that applies to a normal ballistic law but also to
these specific diffusion laws. As we show phenomenological models based on this
theory describe correctly the anomalous conductivity in quasicrystals.
Ab-initio calculations performed on approximants confirm also the validity of
this anomalous quantum diffusion scheme. This provides us with an ab-initio
model of transport in approximants such as alpha-AlMnSi and AlCuFe 1/1 cubic
approximant.
