Using the covariant spectator theory (CST), we present two one boson exchange
kernels that have been successfully adjusted to fit the 2007 world np data
(containing 3788 data) below 350 MeV. One model (which we designate WJC-1) has
27 parameters and fits with a chi2/N = 1.06. The other model (designated WJC-2)
has only 15 parameters and fits with a chi2/N = 1.12. Both of these models also
reproduce the experimental triton binding energy without introducing additional
irreducible three-nucleon forces. One result of this work is a new phase shift
analysis, updated for all data until 2006, which is useful even if one does not
work within the CST. In carrying out these fits we have reviewed the entire
data base, adding new data not previously used in other high precision fits and
restoring some data omitted in previous fits. A full discussion and evaluation
of the 2007 data base is presented.
