We construct a family of continuous biorthogonal functions related to an
elliptic analogue of the Gauss hypergeometric function. The key tools used for
that are the elliptic beta integral and the integral Bailey chain introduced
earlier by the author. Relations to the Sklyanin algebra and elliptic analogues
of the Faddeev modular double are discussed in detail.
