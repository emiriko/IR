An introduction is provided to some current research trends in stability in
geometric invariant theory and the problem of Kaehler metrics of constant
scalar curvature. Besides classical notions such as Chow-Mumford stability, the
emphasis is on several new stability conditions, such as K-stability,
Donaldson's infinite-dimensional GIT, and conditions on the closure of orbits
of almost-complex structures under the diffeomorphism group. Related analytic
methods are also discussed, including estimates for energy functionals,
Tian-Yau-Zelditch approximations, estimates for moment maps, complex
Monge-Ampere equations and pluripotential theory, and the Kaehler-Ricci flow
