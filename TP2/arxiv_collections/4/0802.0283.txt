We analyze the competing effects of moderate to strong Coulomb
electron-electron interactions and weak quenched disorder in graphene. Using a
one-loop renormalization group calculation controlled within the large-N
approximation, we demonstrate that, at successively lower energy (temperature
or chemical potential) scales, a type of non-Abelian vector potential disorder
always asserts itself as the dominant elastic scattering mechanism for generic
short-ranged microscopic defect distributions. Vector potential disorder is
tied to both elastic lattice deformations ("ripples") and topological lattice
defects. We identify several well-defined scaling regimes, for which we provide
scaling predictions for the electrical conductivity and thermopower, valid when
the inelastic lifetime due to interactions exceeds the elastic lifetime due to
disorder. Coulomb interaction effects should figure strongly into the physics
of suspended graphene films, where rs > 1; we expect vector potential disorder
to play an important role in the description of transport in such films.
