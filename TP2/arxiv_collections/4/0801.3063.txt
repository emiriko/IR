An exact solution of brane universe is studied and the result indicates that
Friedmann equations on the brane are modified with an extra term. This term can
play the role of dark energy and make the universe accelerate. In order to
derive the $\Lambda$CDM Universe from this global brane model, the new
solutions are obtained to describe the $5D$ manifold.
