We report the results of theoretical investigations of low frequency
tunneling current noise spectra component (1/f^{\alpha}). Localized states of
individual impurity atoms play the key role in low frequency tunneling current
noise formation. It is found that switching "on" and "off" of Coulomb
interaction of conduction electrons with one or two charged localized states
results in power law singularity of low-frequency tunneling current noise
spectrum 1/f^{\alpha}. Power law exponent in different low frequency ranges
depends on the relative values of Coulomb interaction of conduction electrons
with different charged impurities.
