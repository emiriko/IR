The static dielectric response of C60, C180, C240, C540, C720, C960, C1500,
and C2160 fullerenes is characterized by an all-electron density-functional
method. First, the screened polarizabilities of C60, C180, C240, and C540, are
determined by the finite-field method using Gaussian basis set containing 35
basis functions per atom. In the second set of calculations, the unscreened
polarizabilities are calculated for fullerenes C60 through C2160 from the
self-consistent Kohn-Sham orbitals and eigen-values using the sum-over-states
method. The approximate screened polarizabilities, obtained by applying a
correction determined within linear response theory show excellent agreement
with the finite-field polarizabilities. The static dipole polarizability per
atom in C2160 is (4 Angstrom^3) three times larger than that in C60 (1.344
Angstrom^3). Our results reduce the uncertainty in various theoretical models
used previously to describe the dielectric response of fullerenes and show that
quantum size effects in polarizability are significantly smaller than
previously thought.
