The number of droplets which may be formed with a supersaturated vapor in
presence of a gas cannot exceed a number proportional to (pv-pvo)4 where pv and
pvo denote at the same temperature the pressure of the supersaturated vapor-gas
mixture and the pressure of the saturated vapor-gas mixture. The energy
necessary to the droplet formation is also bounded by a number proportional to
(pv-pvo)2 .
