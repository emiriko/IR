In this paper, we address the power-aware scheduling of sporadic
constrained-deadline hard real-time tasks using dynamic voltage scaling upon
multiprocessor platforms. We propose two distinct algorithms. Our first
algorithm is an off-line speed determination mechanism which provides an
identical speed for each processor. That speed guarantees that all deadlines
are met if the jobs are scheduled using EDF. The second algorithm is an on-line
and adaptive speed adjustment mechanism which reduces the energy consumption
while the system is running.
