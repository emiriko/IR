One of the most striking quantum effects in a low temperature interacting
Bose gas is superfluidity. First observed in liquid 4He, this phenomenon has
been intensively studied in a variety of systems for its amazing features such
as the persistence of superflows and the quantization of the angular momentum
of vortices. The achievement of Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) in dilute
atomic gases provided an exceptional opportunity to observe and study
superfluidity in an extremely clean and controlled environment. In the solid
state, Bose-Einstein condensation of exciton polaritons has now been reported
several times. Polaritons are strongly interacting light-matter
quasi-particles, naturally occurring in semiconductor microcavities in the
strong coupling regime and constitute a very interesting example of composite
bosons. Even though pioneering experiments have recently addressed the
propagation of a fluid of coherent polaritons, still no conclusive evidence is
yet available of its superfluid nature. In the present Letter, we report the
observation of spontaneous formation of pinned quantised vortices in the
Bose-condensed phase of a polariton fluid by means of phase and amplitude
imaging. Theoretical insight into the possible origin of such vortices is
presented in terms of a generalised Gross-Pitaevskii equation. The implications
of our observations concerning the superfluid nature of the non-equilibrium
polariton fluid are finally discussed.
