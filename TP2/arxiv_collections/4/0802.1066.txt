We report the results of dynamical mean field calculations for the metallic
Kondo lattice model subject to an applied magnetic field. High-quality spectral
functions reveal that the picture of rigid, hybridized bands, Zeeman-shifted in
proportion to the field strength, is qualitatively correct. We find evidence of
a zero-temperature magnetization plateau, whose onset coincides with the
chemical potential entering the spin up hybridization gap. The plateau appears
at the field scale predicted by (static) large-N mean field theory and has a
magnetization value consistent with that of x=1-n_c spin-polarized heavy holes,
where n_c < 1 is the conduction band filling of the noninteracting system. We
argue that the emergence of the plateau at low temperature marks the onset of
quasiparticle coherence.
