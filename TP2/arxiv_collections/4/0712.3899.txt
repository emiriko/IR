We propose and demonstrate experimentally the concept of the annular
interdigital transducer that focuses acoustic waves on the surface of a
piezoelectric material to a single, diffraction-limited, spot. The shape of the
transducing fingers follows the wave surface. Experiments conducted on lithium
niobate substrates evidence that the generated surface waves converge to the
center of the transducer, producing a spot that shows a large concentration of
acoustic energy. This concept is of practical significance to design new
intense microacoustic sources, for instance for enhanced acouto-optical
interactions.
