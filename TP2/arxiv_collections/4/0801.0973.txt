We present our preliminary analysis for the chamonium and D$_s$ spectra
obtained from N$_f=2$ dynamical anisotropic lattices. We use 12$^3\times 80$
lattices with lattice spacing $a_t=7.35$ GeV$^{-1}$ and anisotropy of six.
Meson correlators are computed using all-to-all propagators together with
variational analysis.
