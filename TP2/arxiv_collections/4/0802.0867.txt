X-ray photoelectron emission microscopy in combination with x-ray magnetic
circular dichroism is used to investigate the influence of an applied magnetic
field on N\'eel caps (i.e., surface terminations of asymmetric Bloch walls).
Self-assembled micron-sized Fe(110) dots displaying a moderate distribution of
size and aspect ratios serve as model objects. Investigations of remanent
states after application of an applied field along the direction of N\'eel-cap
magnetization give clear evidence for the magnetization reversal of the N\'eel
caps around 120 mT, with a $\pm$20 mT dispersion. No clear correlation could be
found between the value of the reversal field and geometrical features of the
dots.
