We study the properties of two dimensional topological spin hall insulators
which arise through spontaneous breakdown of spin symmetry in systems that are
spin rotation invariant. Such a phase breaks spin rotation but not time
reversal symmetry and has a vector order parameter. Skyrmion configurations in
this vector order parameter are shown to have electric charge that is twice the
electron charge. When the spin Hall order is destroyed by condensation of
skyrmions superconductivity results. This may happen either through doping or
at fixed filling by tuning interactions to close the skyrmion gap. In the
latter case the superconductor- spin Hall insulator quantum phase transition
can be second order even though the two phases break distinct symmetries.
