Jet quenching has become an essential signal for the characterization of the
medium formed in experiments of heavy-ion collisions. After a brief
introduction to the field, we present the full derivation of the medium-induced
gluon radiation spectrum, starting from the diagrammatical origin of the Wilson
lines and the medium averages and including all intermediate steps. The
application of this spectrum to actual phenomenological calculations is then
presented, making comparisons with experimental data and indicating some
improvements of the formalism to the future LHC program. The last part of the
lectures reviews calculations based on the AdS/CFT correspondence on the medium
parameters controlling the jet quenching phenomenon.
