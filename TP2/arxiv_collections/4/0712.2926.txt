Based on an effective QCD Lagrangian we discuss the properties of charge
density fluctuations in the vicinity of chiral phase transition. We explore
thermodynamics in the presence of spinodal phase separation. We show that
appearance of spinodal decomposition in a non-equilibrium first order phase
transition results in divergence of the charge density fluctuations related
with the electric charge and baryon number conservation. Consequently,
divergent fluctuations at the chiral phase transition are not only attributed
to the critical end point but are also there along the first order phase
transition if the spinodal phase separation take place. Based on the mean field
dynamics, the critical exponents for these singular behavior of charge
susceptibilities are also discussed.
