Invariant transformation for quantum mechanical systems is proposed. A
cloaking of matter wave can be realized at given energy by designing the
potential and effective mass of the matter waves in the cloaking region. The
general conditions required for such a cloaking are determined and confirmed by
both the wave and particle (classical) approaches. We show that it may be
possible to construct such a cloaking system for cold atoms using optical
lattices.
