The analysis of the deuteron production in p--Be interactions at 450 GeV/c
taken by the NA56/SPY experiment at CERN SPS is presented. In the framework of
the coalescence model, the coalescence factor $\kappa$ is determined as $(0.79
\pm 0.05 \pm 0.13) \times 10^{-2}$. Our results disfavour the hypothesis that
coalescence be the dominant mechanism for deuteron production in $p+Be$
interactions at low $p_T$.
