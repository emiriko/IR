We report on transport characteristics of quantum dot devices etched entirely
in graphene. At large sizes, they behave as conventional single-electron
transistors, exhibiting periodic Coulomb blockade peaks. For quantum dots
smaller than 100 nm, the peaks become strongly non-periodic indicating a major
contribution of quantum confinement. Random peak spacing and its statistics are
well described by the theory of chaotic neutrino (Dirac) billiards. Short
constrictions of only a few nm in width remain conductive and reveal a
confinement gap of up to 0.5eV, which demonstrates the in-principle possibility
of molecular-scale electronics based on graphene.
