By studying a tachyon field on the DGP brane model, in order to embed the 4D
standard Friedmann equation with a brane tachyon field in 5D bulk, the metric
of the 5D spacetime is presented. Then, adopting the inverse square potential
of tachyon field, we obtain an expanding universe with power-law on the brane
and an exact 5D solution.
