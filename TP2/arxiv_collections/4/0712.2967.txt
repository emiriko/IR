We study the Josephson current through a ballistic normal metal layer of
thickness $D$ on which two superconducting electrodes are deposited within a
distance $L$ of each other. In the presence of an ({\it in-layer}) magnetic
field we find that the oscillations of the critical current $I_c(\Phi)$ with
the magnetic flux $\Phi$ are significantly different from an ordinary magnetic
interference pattern. Depending on the ratio $L/D$ and temperature,
$I_c(\Phi)$-oscillations can have a period smaller than flux quantum $\Phi_0$,
nonzero minima and damping rate much smaller than $1/\Phi$. Similar anomalous
magnetic interference pattern was recently observed experimentally.
