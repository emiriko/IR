Here we consider a class of $2\otimes2\otimes d$ chessboard density matrices
starting with three-qubit ones which have positive partial transposes with
respect to all subsystems. To investigate the entanglement of these density
matrices, we use the entanglement witness approach. For constructing
entanglement witnesses (EWs) detecting these density matrices, we attempt to
convert the problem to an exact convex optimization problem. To this aim, we
map the convex set of separable states into a convex region, named feasible
region, and consider cases that the exact geometrical shape of feasible region
can be obtained. In this way, various linear and non-linear EWs are
constructed. The optimality and decomposability of some of introduced EWs are
also considered. Furthermore, the detection of the density matrices by
introduced EWs are discussed analytically and numerically.
