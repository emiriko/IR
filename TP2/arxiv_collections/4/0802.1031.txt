In this article we develop some new existence results for the Einstein
constraint equations using the Lichnerowicz-York conformal rescaling method.
The mean extrinsic curvature is taken to be an arbitrary smooth function
without restrictions on the size of its spatial derivatives, so that it can be
arbitrarily far from constant. The rescaled background metric belongs to the
positive Yamabe class, and the freely specifiable part of the data given by the
traceless-transverse part of the rescaled extrinsic curvature and the matter
fields are taken to be sufficiently small, with the matter energy density not
identically zero. Using topological fixed-point arguments and global barrier
constructions, we then establish existence of solutions to the constraints. Two
recent advances in the analysis of the Einstein constraint equations make this
result possible: A new type of topological fixed-point argument without
smallness conditions on spatial derivatives of the mean extrinsic curvature,
and a new construction of global super-solutions for the Hamiltonian constraint
that is similarly free of such conditions on the mean extrinsic curvature. For
clarity, we present our results only for strong solutions on closed manifolds.
However, our results also hold for weak solutions and for other cases such as
compact manifolds with boundary; these generalizations will appear elsewhere.
The existence results presented here for the Einstein constraints are
apparently the first such results that do not require smallness conditions on
spatial derivatives of the mean extrinsic curvature.
