We discuss an extension of time-dependent density-functional theory by a
self-interaction correction (SIC). A strictly variational formulation is given
taking care of the necessary constraints. A manageable and transparent
propagation scheme using two sets of wavefunctions is proposed and applied to
laser excitation with subsequent ionization of a dimer molecule.
