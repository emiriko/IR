Micro Porosity Sintered wick is made from metal injection molding processes,
which provides a wick density with micro scale. It can keep more than 53 %
working fluid inside the wick structure, and presents good pumping ability on
working fluid transmission by fine infiltrated effect. Capillary pumping
ability is the important factor in heat pipe design, and those general
applications on wick structure are manufactured with groove type or screen
type. Gravity affects capillary of these two types more than a sintered wick
structure does, and mass heat transfer through vaporized working fluid
determines the thermal performance of a vapor chamber. First of all, high
density of porous wick supports high transmission ability of working fluid. The
wick porosity is sintered in micro scale, which limits the bubble size while
working fluid vaporizing on vapor section. Maximum heat transfer capacity
increases dramatically as thermal resistance of wick decreases. This study on
permeability design of wick structure is 0.5 - 0.7, especially permeability (R)
= 0.5 can have the best performance, and its heat conductivity is 20 times to a
heat pipe with diameter (Phi) = 10mm. Test data of this vapor chamber shows
thermal performance increases over 33 %.
