We propose a regular black hole whose inside generates a de Sitter space and
then is finally frustrated into a singularity. It is a modified model which was
suggested originally by Frolov, Markov, and Mukhanov. In our model, we could
adjust a regular black hole so that its period before going into the extreme
state is much longer than the information retention time. During this period an
observer could exist who observes the information of the Hawking radiation,
falls freely into the regular center of the black hole, and finally meets the
free-falling information again. The existence of such an observer implies that
the complementary view may not be consistent with a regular black hole, and
therefore, is not appropriate as a generic principle of black hole physics.
