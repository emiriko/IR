The best level of ordering and straightening of carbon nanotube arrays is
often achieved when they are grown in a dielectric matrix, so such structures
present the most suitable candidates for future channeling experiments with
carbon nanotubes. Consequently, we investigate here how the dynamic
polarization of carbon valence electrons in the presence of various surrounding
dielectric media affects the angular distributions of protons channeled through
(11,~9) single-wall carbon nanotubes. Proton speeds between 3 and 10 a.u.,
corresponding to energies of 0.223 and 2.49 MeV, are chosen with the nanotube's
length varied between 0.1 and 1 $\mu$m. We describe the repulsive interaction
between a proton and the nanotube's atoms in a continuum-potential
approximation based on the Doyle-Turner potential, whereas the attractive image
force on a proton is calculated using a two-dimensional hydrodynamic model for
the dynamic response of the nanotube valence electrons, while assigning to the
surrounding medium an appropriate (frequency dependent) dielectric function.
The angular distributions of channeled protons are generated using a computer
simulation method which solves the proton equations of motion in the transverse
plane numerically. Our analysis shows that the presence of a dielectric medium
can strongly affect both the appearance and positions of maxima in the angular
distributions of channeled protons.
