The Landau potential in the general Ginzburg-Landau theory with two order
parameters and all possible quadratic and quartic terms cannot be minimized
with the straightforward algebra. Here, a geometric approach is presented that
circumvents this computational difficulty and allows one to get insight into
many properties of the model in the mean-field approximation.
