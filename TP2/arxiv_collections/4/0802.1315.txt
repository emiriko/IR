If hidden sector photons exist, they could be produced through oscillations
of photons emitted by the Sun. We show that a search for these particles could
be performed in Super-Kamiokande due to the presence in this detector of a
large number of photomultiplier's (PMTs) with a relatively low noise and big
size. These particles would penetrate the Earth shielding and would be detected
by PMTs through their oscillations into real photons inside the PMTs vacuum
volume. This would results in an increase of the PMT counting rate and it daily
variations depending on the Earth position with respect to the Sun. The
proposed search for this effect is sensitive to the photon-hidden photon mixing
strength as small as ~10^{-6} for the hidden photon mass region ~10^{-3} -
10^{-1} eV and, in the case of nonobservation, could improve limits recently
obtained from photon regeneration laser experiments for this mass region.
