Data on pion polarizabilities obtained in different experiments are reviewed.
The values of the dipole and quadrupole polarizabilities of the pi^0 and
pi^{+-} mesons found are compared with predictions of dispersion sum rules
(DSRs) and two-loop calculations in the framework of chiral perturbation theory
(ChPT). Possible reasons of a difference between the predictions of DSRs and
ChPT are discussed.
