Topos theory, a branch of category theory, has been proposed as mathematical
basis for the formulation of physical theories. In this article, we give a
brief introduction to this approach, emphasising the logical aspects. Each
topos serves as a `mathematical universe' with an internal logic, which is used
to assign truth-values to all propositions about a physical system. We show in
detail how this works for (algebraic) quantum theory.
