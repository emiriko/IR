In the present paper the resonances of vibrational modes in one-dimensional
random Morse lattice are found and analyzed. The resonance energy exchange is
observed at some values of elongation. Resonance $2 \omega_1 = \omega_2$ is
investigated in details. The interacting modes are inequivalent: the
higher-frequency mode is much more stable in the excited state, i.e. its
life-time is larger than the life-time of lower-frequency mode under the
resonance conditions. Simple model of two nonlinearly coupled harmonic
oscillators is also considered. It allows to get analytical description and to
investigate the kinetics and the energy exchange degree vs. such parameters as
the resonance detuning and specific energy. The very similar behavior is found
in the Morse and the two-oscillatory models, and an excellent agreement between
analytical and numerical results is obtained. Analogous resonance phenomena are
also found in the random Fermi-Pasta-Ulam lattice under contraction.
