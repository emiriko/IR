We present a neutron polarimetric experiment where two kinds of spinor
precessions are observed: one is induced by different total energy of neutrons
(zero-field precession) and the other is induced by a stationary guide field
(Larmor precession). A characteristic of the former is the dependence of the
energy-difference, which is in practice tuned by the frequency of the
interacting oscillating magnetic field. In contrast the latter completely
depends on the strength of the guide field, namely Larmor frequency. Our
neutron-polarimetric experiment exhibits individual tuning as well as specific
properties of each spinor precession, which assures the use of both spin
precessions for multi-entangled spinor manipulation.
