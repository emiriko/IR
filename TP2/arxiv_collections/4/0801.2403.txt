This Letter studies the quasispecies dynamics of a population capable of
genetic repair evolving on a time-dependent fitness landscape. We develop a
model that considers an asexual population of single-stranded, conservatively
replicating genomes, whose only source of genetic variation is due to copying
errors during replication. We consider a time-dependent, single-fitness-peak
landscape where the master sequence changes by a single point mutation every
time $ \tau $. We are able to analytically solve for the evolutionary dynamics
of the population in the point-mutation limit. In particular, our model
provides an analytical expression for the fraction of mutators in the dynamic
fitness landscape that agrees well with results from stochastic simulations.
