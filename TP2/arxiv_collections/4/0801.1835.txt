First and second order corrections for the scattering of different types of
particles by a weak gravitational field, treated as an external field, are
calculated. These computations indicate a violation of the Equivalence
Principle: to first order, the cross-sections are spin dependent; if the
calculations are pushed to the next order, they become dependent upon energy as
well. Interesting enough, the aforementioned results are equivalent to those
obtained by means of the so-called Effective Theory of Gravitation, in the
limit in which one of the masses is much greater than all the other energies
involved. We discuss also some applications of our research, such as the
determination of an upper bound for the photon mass, and the possible
detection, in the foreseeable future, of these violations of the Equivalence
Principle.
