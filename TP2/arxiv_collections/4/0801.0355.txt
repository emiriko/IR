Radii of sensitivity were estimated for the $^{6}$Li+$^{58,64}$Ni system at
energies near the Coulomb barrier. For comparison purposes, such radii were
also estimated for stable $^{16}$O scattered from same target isotopes. The
elastic scattering data were analysed with folded real potential generated from
DDM3Y nucleon-nucleon interaction and an imaginary potential of volume
Woods-Saxon form. The most sensitive radii for $^{16}$O+$^{58,64}$Ni system are
found to be energy independent and close to the strong absorption radius. For
$^{6}$Li projectile, unlike its strongly bound counterpart, the crossing radius
increases with decreasing energy. However, no two crossing situation has been
observed for both $^{6}$Li+$^{58,64}$Ni and $^{16}$O+$^{58,64}$Ni systems at
the top of the barrier.
