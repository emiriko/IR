Collections of non-Brownian particles suspended in a viscous fluid and
subjected to oscillatory shear at very low Reynolds number have recently been
shown to exhibit a remarkable dynamical phase transition separating reversible
from irreversible behaviour as the strain amplitude or volume fraction are
increased. We present a simple model for this phenomenon, based on which we
argue that this transition lies in the universality class of the conserved DP
models or, equivalently, the Manna model. This leads to predictions for the
scaling behaviour of a large number of experimental observables. Non-Brownian
suspensions under oscillatory shear may thus constitute the first experimental
realization of an inactive-active phase transition which is not in the
universality class of conventional directed percolation.
