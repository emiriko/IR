We consider an extension of the scalar sector of the Standard Model with a
single complex Higgs triplet $X$. Such extensions are the most economic,
model-independent way of generating neutrino masses through triplet
interactions. We show that a term like $\azero\Phi\Phi X^\dag$ must be included
in the most general potential of such a scenario, in order to avoid a massless
neutral physical scalar. We also demonstrate that $\azero$ must be real, thus
ruling out any additional source of CP-violation. We then examine the
implications of this term in the mass matrices of the singly-and doubly-charged
scalar, neutral scalar and pseudoscalar fields. We find that, for small values
of $\azero/\vtwo$, where $\vtwo$ is the triplet vev, the spectrum allows the
decay of heavier scalars into lighter ones via gauge interactions. For large
$\azero/\vtwo$, the doubly-charged, singly-charged and neutral pseudoscalar
bosons become practically degenerate, while the even-parity neutral scalars
remain considerably lighter, thus emphasizing the possibility of decay of the
singly-charged or neutral pseudoscalar states into the neutral scalars.
Constraints from the $\rho$-parameter are used to find nontrivial limits on the
charged Higgs mass depending on $\azero$. We also study the couplings of the
various physical states in this scenario. For small values of $|\azero|/\vtwo$,
we find the lightest neutral scalar field to be triplet-dominated, and thus
having extremely suppressed interactions with fermion as well as gauge boson
pairs.
