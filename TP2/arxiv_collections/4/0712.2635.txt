Spin correlations and fluctuations in the 3d-transition-metal-based
icosahedral quasicrystal Zn-Fe-Sc have been investigated by neutron scattering
using polycrystalline samples. Magnetic diffuse scattering has been observed in
the elastic experiment at low temperatures, indicating development of static
short-range-spin correlations. In addition, the inelastic scattering experiment
detects a $Q$-independent quasielastic signal ascribed to single-site
relaxational spin fluctuations. Above the macroscopic freezing temperature
$T_{\rm f} \simeq 7$ K, the spin relaxation rate shows Arrhenius-type behavior,
indicating thermally activated relaxation process. In contrast, the relaxation
rate remains finite even at the lowest temperature, suggesting a certain
quantum origin for the spin fluctuations below $T_{\rm f}$.
