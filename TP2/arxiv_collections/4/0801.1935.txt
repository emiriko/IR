A phenomenological model with an extreme accuracy is proposed for the cosmic
time variation of the primordial fundamental constants (e, h, G and c) and the
leptonic masses. The model is purely exploratory in that at the very early
times the light speed is purposely modeled to be negligibly small, indicating a
very slowly expanding universe around t=0. The impact of this idea in cosmology
and its modeling is overwhelming.
