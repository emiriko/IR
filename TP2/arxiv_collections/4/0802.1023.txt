This paper shows a novel calculation of the mean square displacement of a
classical Brownian particle in a relativistic thermal bath. The result is
compared with the expressions obtained by other authors. Also, the
thermodynamic properties of a non-degenerate simple relativistic gas are
reviewed in terms of a treatment performed in velocity space.
