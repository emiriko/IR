We demonstrate the existence of multiple converging sequences in the ab
initio no-core shell model. By examining the underlying theory of effective
operators, we expose the physical foundations for the alternative pathways to
convergence. This leads us to propose a revised strategy for evaluating
effective interactions for $A$-body calculations in restricted model spaces. We
suggest that this strategy is particularly useful for applications to nuclear
processes in which states of both parities are used simultaneously, such as for
transition rates. We demonstrate the utility of our strategy with large-scale
calculations in light nuclei.
