We show that adsorbates on surfaces can form islands even if there are no
attractive interactions. Instead strong repulsion between adsorbates at short
distances can lead to islands, because such islands increase the entropy of the
adsorbates that are not part of the islands. We suggest that this mechanism
cause the observed island formation in O/Pt(111), but it may be important for
many other systems as well.
