Using the variational approximation and numerical simulations, we study
one-dimensional gap solitons in a binary Bose-Einstein condensate trapped in an
optical-lattice potential. We consider the case of inter-species repulsion,
while the intra-species interaction may be either repulsive or attractive.
Several types of gap solitons are found: symmetric or asymmetric; unsplit or
split, if centers of the components coincide or separate; intra-gap (with both
chemical potentials falling into a single bandgap) or inter-gap, otherwise. In
the case of the intra-species attraction, a smooth transition takes place
between solitons in the semi-infinite gap, the ones in the first finite
bandgap, and semi-gap solitons (with one component in a bandgap and the other
in the semi-infinite gap).
