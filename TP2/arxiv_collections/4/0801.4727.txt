We derive a semiclassical expression for the Green's function in graphene, in
which the presence of a semiclassical phase is made apparent. The relationship
between this semiclassical phase and the adiabatic Berry phase, usually
referred to in this context, is discussed. These phases coincide for the
perfectly linear Dirac dispersion relation. They differ however when a gap is
opened at the Dirac point. We furthermore present several applications of our
semiclassical formalism. In particular we provide, for various configurations,
a semiclassical derivation of the electron's Landau levels, illustrating the
role of the semiclassical ``Berry-like'' phase
