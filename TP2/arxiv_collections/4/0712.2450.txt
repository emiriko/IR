Interacting dark energy and the holographic principle offer a possible way of
addressing the cosmic coincidence problem as well as accounting for the size of
the dark energy component. The equilibrium points of the Friedmann equations
which govern the evolution behavior of dark energy, matter, and curvature
components can determine the qualitative behavior of the cosmological models.
These possible equilibria and their behavior are examined in a general
framework, and some illustrative examples are presented.
