There is compelling evidence for a strong electron-phonon interaction (EPI)
in cuprate superconductors from the isotope effects on the supercarrier mass,
high resolution angle resolved photoemission spectroscopies (ARPES), a number
of optical and neutron-scattering measurements in accordance with our
prediction of high-temperature superconductivity in polaronic liquids. A number
of observations point to the possibility that high-Tc cuprate superconductors
may not be conventional Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) superconductors, but
rather derive from the Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) of real-space pairs,
which are mobile small bipolarons. Here I review the bipolaron theory of
unconventional proximity effects, the symmetry and checkerboard modulations of
the order parameter and quantum magneto-oscillations discovered recently in
cuprates.
