The coupling between $z$ valleys in the conduction band of a Si quantum well
arises from phenomena occurring within several atoms from the interface, thus
ruling out a theoretical description based on pure effective mass theory.
However, the complexity and size of a realistic device precludes an analytical
atomistic description. Here, we develop a fully analytical multiscale theory of
valley coupling, by combining effective mass and tight binding approaches. The
results are of particular interest for silicon qubits and quantum devices, but
also provide insight for GaAs quantum wells.
