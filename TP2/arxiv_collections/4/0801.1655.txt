In this paper, we survey the rich theory of infinite episturmian words which
generalize to any finite alphabet, in a rather resembling way, the well-known
family of Sturmian words on two letters. After recalling definitions and basic
properties, we consider episturmian morphisms that allow for a deeper study of
these words. Some properties of factors are described, including factor
complexity, palindromes, fractional powers, frequencies, and return words. We
also consider lexicographical properties of episturmian words, as well as their
connection to the balance property, and related notions such as finite
episturmian words, Arnoux-Rauzy sequences, and "episkew words" that generalize
the skew words of Morse and Hedlund.
