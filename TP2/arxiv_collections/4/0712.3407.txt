We investigate the dynamical phase diagram of the fractional Langevin
equation and show that critical exponents mark dynamical transitions in the
behavior of the system. For a free and harmonically bound particle the critical
exponent $\alpha_c= 0.402\pm 0.002$ marks a transition to a non-monotonic
under-damped phase. The critical exponent $\alpha_{R}=0.441...$ marks a
transition to a resonance phase, when an external oscillating field drives the
system. Physically, we explain these behaviors using a cage effect, where the
medium induces an elastic type of friction. Phase diagrams describing the
under-damped, the over-damped and critical frequencies of the fractional
oscillator, recently used to model single protein experiments, show behaviors
vastly different from normal.
