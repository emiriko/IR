In this work we derive a theory of polariton condensation based on the theory
of interacting Bose particles. In particular, we describe self-consistently the
linear exciton-photon coupling and the exciton-nonlinearities, by generalizing
the Hartree-Fock-Popov description of BEC to the case of two coupled Bose
fields at thermal equilibrium. In this way, we compute the density-dependent
one-particle spectrum, the energy occupations and the phase diagram. The
results quantitatively agree with the existing experimental findings. We then
present the equations for the linear response of a polariton condensate and we
predict the spectral response of the system to external optical or mechanical
perturbations.
