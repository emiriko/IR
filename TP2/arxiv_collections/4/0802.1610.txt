We study the nonlinear dynamics of collective excitation in a $N$-site $XXZ$
quantum spin chain, which is manipulated by an oblique magnetic field. We show
that, when the tilted field is applied along the magic angle $\theta_{0}
=\pm\arccos \sqrt{1/3}$, the anisotropic Heisenberg spin chain becomes
isotropic and thus an free propagating spin wave is stimulated. And in the
regime of the tilted angle larger and smaller then the magic angle, two types
of nonlinear excitations appear, which are bright soliton and dark soliton.
