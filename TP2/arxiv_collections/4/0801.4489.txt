Full Faddeev-type calculations are performed for $^{11}$Be breakup on proton
target at 38.4, 100, and 200 MeV/u incident energies. The convergence of the
multiple scattering expansion is investigated. The results are compared with
those of other frameworks like Distorted Wave Impulse Approximation that are
based on an incomplete and truncated multiple scattering expansion.
