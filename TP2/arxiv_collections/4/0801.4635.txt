In this paper it is shown that an equivalent to the complex Klein-Gordon
equation can be obtained from the (2+3) dimensional Einstein equations coupled
to a conserved energy momentum tensor. In an explicit toy model we give
matching conditions for what corresponds to the phase, the amplitude, and the
mass of the complex wave function.
