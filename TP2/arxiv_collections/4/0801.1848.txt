New theoretical and experimental investigation of the occupied and unoccupied
local electronic density of states (DOS) are reported for alpha-Li3N. Band
structure and density functional theory calculations confirm the absence of
covalent bonding character. However, real-space full-multiple-scattering
(RSFMS) calculations of the occupied local DOS finds less extreme nominal
valences than have previously been proposed. Nonresonant inelastic x-ray
scattering (NRIXS), RSFMS calculations, and calculations based on the
Bethe-Salpeter equation are used to characterize the unoccupied electronic
final states local to both the Li and N sites. There is good agreement between
experiment and theory. Throughout the Li 1s near-edge region, both experiment
and theory find strong similarities in the s- and p-type components of the
unoccupied local final density of states projected onto an orbital angular
momentum basis (l-DOS). An unexpected, significant correspondence exists
between the near-edge spectra for the Li 1s and N 1s initial states. We argue
that both spectra are sampling essentially the same final density of states due
to the combination of long core-hole lifetimes, long photoelectron lifetimes,
and the fact that orbital angular momentum is the same for all relevant initial
states. Such considerations may be generically applicable for low atomic number
compounds.
