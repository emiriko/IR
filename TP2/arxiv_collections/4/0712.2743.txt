We study a refined large spin limit for twist operators in the sl(2) sector
of AdS/CFT. We derive a novel non-perturbative equation for the generalized
two-parameter scaling function associated to this limit, and analyze it at weak
coupling. It is expected to smoothly interpolate between weakly coupled gauge
theory and string theory at strong coupling.
