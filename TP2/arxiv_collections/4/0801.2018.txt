The phenomenological neutrino mass matrix for two-zero symmetric texture has
been obtained and used to rule out all possible two-zero symmetric neutrino
mass matrices obtained from Yukawa couplings to $\mathbf{10}$ and
$\mathbf{126}$ Higgs representations within the framework of minimal
supersymmetric SO(10).
