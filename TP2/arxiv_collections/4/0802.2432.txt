An aperiodic tile set was first constructed by R.Berger while proving the
undecidability of the domino problem. It turned out that aperiodic tile sets
appear in many topics ranging from logic (the Entscheidungsproblem) to physics
(quasicrystals) We present a new construction of an aperiodic tile set that is
based on Kleene's fixed-point construction instead of geometric arguments. This
construction is similar to J. von Neumann self-reproducing automata; similar
ideas were also used by P. Gacs in the context of error-correcting
computations. The flexibility of this construction allows us to construct a
"robust" aperiodic tile set that does not have periodic (or close to periodic)
tilings even if we allow some (sparse enough) tiling errors. This property was
not known for any of the existing aperiodic tile sets.
