Let $\ell \geq 2$ be an integer. For each $\eps >0$ remove from $\R^2$ the
union of discs of radius $\eps$ centered at the integer lattice points $(m,n$,
with $m\nequiv n\mod{\ell}$. Consider a point-like particle moving linearly at
unit speed, with velocity $\omega$, along a trajectory starting at the origin,
and its free path length $\tau_{\ell,\eps} (\omega)\in [0,\infty]$. We prove
the weak convergence of the probability measures associated with the random
variables $\eps \tau_{\ell,\eps}$ as $\eps \to 0^+$ and explicitly compute the
limiting distribution. For $\ell=3$ this leads to an asymptotic formula for the
length of the trajectory of a billiard in a regular hexagon, starting at the
center, with circular pockets of radius $\eps\to 0^+$ removed from the corners.
For $\ell=2$ this corresponds to the trajectory of a billiard in a unit square
with circular pockets removed from the corners and trajectory starting at the
center of the square. The limiting probability measures on $[0,\infty)$ have a
tail at infinity, which contrasts with the case of a square with pockets and
trajectory starting from one of the corners, where the limiting probability
measure has compact support.
