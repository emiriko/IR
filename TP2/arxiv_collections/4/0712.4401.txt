In a recent paper, Creutz has given a new action describing two species of
Dirac fermions with exact chiral symmetry on the lattice. This action depends
on a parameter which may be fixed at a certain value in order to get the right
continuum limit. In this letter, we elaborate more on this idea and present an
action which is free of any other parameter except the fermion mass.
