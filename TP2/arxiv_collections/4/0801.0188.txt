We discuss four general features of force-free evolution: (1) The spatial
spread of any packet changes with time in a very simple way. (2) Over
sufficiently short periods of time (whose duration is related to the spread in
momentum of the packet) the probability distribution moves but there is little
change in shape. (3) After a sufficiently long period (related to the initial
spatial spread) the packet settles into a simple form simply related to the
momentum distribution in the packet. In this asymptotic regime, the shape of
the probability distribution no longer changes except for its scale, which
increases linearly with the time. (4) There is an infinite denumerable set of
simple wave packets (the Hermite-Gauss packets) that do not change shape as
they evolve.
