Electronic anisotropy was studied for overdoped (Y,Ca)Ba2Cu3O7-d with various
doping levels (p). It was found that the pseudogap-like behavior in the
resistivity disappear when p exceeds 0.17, independent of the oxygen
deficiency. The anisotropy ratio (g) estimated from upper critical fields
showed a rapid decrease at around p = 0.18, approaching g = 3 for p > 0.20.
