In this article we prove that given a self-similar interval exchange
transformation T, whose associated matrix verifies a quite general algebraic
condition, there exists an affine interval exchange transformation with
wandering intervals that is semi-conjugated to it. That is, in this context the
existence of Denjoy counterexamples occurs very often, generalizing the result
of M. Cobo in [C].
