We study the Kert\'esz line of the $q$--state Potts model at (inverse)
temperature $\beta$, in presence of an external magnetic field $h$. This line
separates two regions of the phase diagram according to the existence or not of
an infinite cluster in the Fortuin-Kasteleyn representation of the model. It is
known that the Kert\'esz line $h_K (\beta)$ coincides with the line of first
order phase transition for small fields when $q$ is large enough. Here we prove
that the first order phase transition implies a jump in the density of the
infinite cluster, hence the Kert\'esz line remains below the line of first
order phase transition. We also analyze the region of large fields and prove,
using techniques of stochastic comparisons, that $h_K (\beta)$ equals $\log (q
- 1) - \log (\beta - \beta_p)$ to the leading order, as $\beta$ goes to
$\beta_p = - \log (1 - p_c)$ where $p_c$ is the threshold for bond percolation.
