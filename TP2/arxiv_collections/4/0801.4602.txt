We show that chains of interacting Fibonacci anyons can support a wide
variety of collective ground states ranging from extended critical, gapless
phases to gapped phases with ground-state degeneracy and quasiparticle
excitations. In particular, we generalize the Majumdar-Ghosh Hamiltonian to
anyonic degrees of freedom by extending recently studied pairwise anyonic
interactions to three-anyon exchanges. The energetic competition between two-
and three-anyon interactions leads to a rich phase diagram that harbors
multiple critical and gapped phases. For the critical phases and their higher
symmetry endpoints we numerically establish descriptions in terms of
two-dimensional conformal field theories. A topological symmetry protects the
critical phases and determines the nature of gapped phases.
