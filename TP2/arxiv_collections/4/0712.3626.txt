We present an analytical study of the time dependent diffusion coefficient in
a dilute suspension of spheres with partially absorbing boundary condition.
Following Kirkpatrick (J. Chem. Phys. 76, 4255) we obtain a perturbative
expansion for the time dependent particle density using volume fraction $f$ of
spheres as an expansion parameter. The exact single particle $t$-operator for
partially absorbing boundary condition is used to obtain a closed form
time-dependent diffusion coefficient $D(t)$ accurate to first order in the
volume fraction $f$. Short and long time limits of $D(t)$ are checked against
the known short-time results for partially or fully absorbing boundary
conditions and long-time results for reflecting boundary conditions. For fully
absorbing boundary condition the long time diffusion coefficient is found to be
$D(t)=5 a^2/(12 f D_{0} t) +O((D_0t/a^2)^{-2})$, to the first order of
perturbation theory. Here $f$ is small but non-zero, $D_0$ the diffusion
coefficient in the absence of spheres, and $a$ the radius of the spheres. The
validity of this perturbative result is discussed.
