This article introduces the next version of MathPSfrag. MathPSfrag is a
Mathematica package that during export automatically replaces all expressions
in a plot by corresponding LaTeX commands. The new version can also produce
LaTeX independent images; e.g., PDF files for inclusion in pdfLaTeX. Moreover
from these files a preview is generated and shown within Mathematica.
