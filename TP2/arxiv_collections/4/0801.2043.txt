The strong electromagnetic fields present in ultra-peripheral collisions of
heavy-ions offer a possibility to study two-photon and photonuclear collisions
complementary to similar studies with lepton beams but over an increased photon
energy range. This presentation will give an overview of photoproduction at
hadron colliders.
