There are 13 equivalence classes of 2D second order quantum and classical
superintegrable systems with nontrivial potential, each associated with a
quadratic algebra of hidden symmetries. We study the finite and infinite
irreducible representations of the quantum quadratic algebras though the
construction of models in which the symmetries act on spaces of functions of a
single complex variable via either differential operators or difference
operators. In another paper we have already carried out parts of this analysis
for the generic nondegenerate superintegrable system on the complex 2-sphere.
Here we carry it out for a degenerate superintegrable system on the 2-sphere.
We point out the connection between our results and a position dependent mass
Hamiltonian studied by Quesne. We also show how to derive simple models of the
classical quadratic algebras for superintegrable systems and then obtain the
quantum models from the classical models, even though the classical and quantum
quadratic algebras are distinct.
