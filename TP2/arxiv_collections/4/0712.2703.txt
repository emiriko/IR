In this lecture, I explain the gauge-invariant formulation for perturbations
of background spacetimes with untwisted homologous Einstein fibres, which
include lots of practically important spacetimes such as static black holes,
static black branes and rotating black holes in various dimensions. As
applications, we discuss the stability of static black holes in higher
dimensions and flat black branes.
