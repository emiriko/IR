We demonstrate a robust frustration-driven charge-order to superconductivity
transition in the half-filled negative-U extended Hubbard model.
Superconductivity extends over a broad region of the parameter space. We argue
that the model provides the correct insight to understanding unconventional
superconductivity in the organic charge-transfer solids and other
quarter-filled systems.
