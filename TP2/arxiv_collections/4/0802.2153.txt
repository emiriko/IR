Using single-crystal transistors, we have performed a systematic experimental
study of electronic transport through oxidized copper/rubrene interfaces as a
function of temperature and bias. We find that the measurements can be
reproduced quantitatively in terms of the thermionic emission theory for
Schottky diodes, if the effect of the bias-induced barrier lowering is
included. Our analysis emphasizes the role of the coupling between metal and
molecules, which in our devices is weak due to the presence of an oxide layer
at the surface of the copper electrodes.
