For any master equation which is local in time, whether Markovian,
non-Markovian, of Lindblad form or not, a general procedure is reviewed for
constructing the corresponding linear map from the initial state to the state
at time t, including its Kraus-type representations. Formally, this is
equivalent to solving the master equation. For an N-dimensional Hilbert space
it requires (i) solving a first order N^2 x N^2 matrix time evolution (to
obtain the completely positive map), and (ii) diagonalising a related N^2 x N^2
matrix (to obtain a Kraus-type representation). Conversely, for a given
time-dependent linear map, a necessary and sufficient condition is given for
the existence of a corresponding master equation, where the (not necessarily
unique) form of this equation is explicitly determined. It is shown that a
`best possible' master equation may always be defined, for approximating the
evolution in the case that no exact master equation exists. Examples involving
qubits are given.
