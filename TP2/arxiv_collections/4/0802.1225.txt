We present a detailed derivation of the stochastic master equation
determining the time evolution of the state of a general quantum system, which
is placed inside a cavity and subjected to indirect measurements by monitoring
the state of electromagnetic radiation transmitted through the cavity. The
derivation is based on the physics involved and the final result is stated in
terms of the physical parameters of the setup. To illustrate the predictions
contained in the equation, we solve it analytically for a specific system, and
we demonstrate quantum jumps and freezing of the internal coherent dynamics of
the system as a result of continued measurements.
