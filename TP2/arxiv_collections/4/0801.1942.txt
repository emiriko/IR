Let $k$ be an algebraically closed field of characteristic $p>0$ and $C$ a
connected nonsingular projective curve over $k$ with genus $g \geq 2$. This
paper continues the work begun by Lehr and Matignon, namely the study of "big
actions", i.e. the pairs $(C,G)$ where $G$ is a $p$-subgroup of the
$k$-automorphism group of $C$ such that$\frac{|G|}{g} >\frac{2 p}{p-1}$. If
$G_2$ denotes the second ramification group of $G$ at the unique ramification
point of the cover $C \to C/G$, we display necessary conditions on $G_2$ for
$(C,G)$ to be a big action, which allows us to pursue the classification of big
actions. Our main source of examples comes from the construction of curves with
many rational points using ray class field theory for global function fields,
as initiated by J-P. Serre and followed by Lauter and Auer. In particular, we
obtain explicit examples of big actions with $G_2$ abelian of large exponent.
