Convex polyhedral abstractions of logic programs have been found very useful
in deriving numeric relationships between program arguments in order to prove
program properties and in other areas such as termination and complexity
analysis. We present a tool for constructing polyhedral analyses of
(constraint) logic programs. The aim of the tool is to make available, with a
convenient interface, state-of-the-art techniques for polyhedral analysis such
as delayed widening, narrowing, "widening up-to", and enhanced automatic
selection of widening points. The tool is accessible on the web, permits user
programs to be uploaded and analysed, and is integrated with related program
transformations such as size abstractions and query-answer transformation. We
then report some experiments using the tool, showing how it can be conveniently
used to analyse transition systems arising from models of embedded systems, and
an emulator for a PIC microcontroller which is used for example in wearable
computing systems. We discuss issues including scalability, tradeoffs of
precision and computation time, and other program transformations that can
enhance the results of analysis.
