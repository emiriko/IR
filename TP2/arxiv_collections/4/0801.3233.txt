Let X be a smooth algebraic variety over a field of characteristic 0. We
introduce the notion of twisted associative (resp. Poisson) deformation of the
structure sheaf O_X. These are stack-like versions of usual deformations. We
prove that there is a twisted quantization map from twisted Poisson
deformations to twisted associative deformations, which is canonical and
bijective on equivalence classes.
