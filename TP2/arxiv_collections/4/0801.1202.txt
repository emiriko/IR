We study the role of zero-point-fluctuations (ZPF) in dephasing at low
temperature. Unlike the Caldeira-Leggett model where the interaction is with an
homogeneous fluctuating field of force, here we consider the effect of short
range scattering by localized bath modes. We find that in presence of ZPF the
inelastic cross-section gets renormalized. Thus indirectly ZPF might contribute
to the dephasing at low temperature.
