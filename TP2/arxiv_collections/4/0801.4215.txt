In this paper we study the chiral symmetry breaking in the hard wall AdS/QCD
model. We solve the equations of motion up to the second order at large
momentum and obtain the first few terms in the expansion of the "left-right"
correlator, which is the measure of symmetry breaking. We study the dependence
on AdS radius to get the result as the series in t'Hooft constant.
