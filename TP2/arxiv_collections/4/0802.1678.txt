Deeply virtual meson scattering cross sections and asymmetries for the pi^0
and eta exclusive electroproduction in a very wide kinematic range of Q^2, t
and x_B have been measured with CLAS (JLab). Initial analysis is already
showing remarkable results. These data will help us to better understand the
transition from soft to hard mechanisms.
