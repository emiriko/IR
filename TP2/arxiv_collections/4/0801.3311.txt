According to the widely accepted notion, the Schr{\"o}dinger equation (SE) is
not derivable in principle. Contrary to this belief, we present here a
straightforward derivation of SE. It is based on only two fundamentals of
mechanics: the classical Hamilton-Jacobi equation(HJE) and the Planck postulate
about the discrete transfer of energy at micro-scales. Our approach is
drastically different from the other published derivations of SE which either
employ an ad hoc underlying assumption about the probabilistic or the
statistical nature of the micro-scale phenomena, or rely on the prior knowledge
of SE and arrive at it by introducing a new postulate - neither present in
classical mechanics nor following from experiments - with a suitable but
physically unjustifiable choice of a key arbitrary constant.
