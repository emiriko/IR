We study the dynamics of fronts in parametrically forced oscillating
lattices. Using as a prototypical example the discrete Ginzburg-Landau
equation, we show that much information about front bifurcations can be
extracted by projecting onto a cylindrical phase space. Starting from a normal
form that describes the nonequilibrium Ising-Bloch bifurcation in the continuum
and using symmetry arguments, we derive a simple dynamical system that captures
the dynamics of fronts in the lattice. We can expect our approach to be
extended to other pattern-forming problems on lattices.
