It has been proposed that multifragmentation can be related to the liquid-gas
phase transition of nuclear matter. We study the statistical properties of
finite nuclear matter near the phase transition with the help of a Lattice Gas
Model (LGM). The original version of LGM with only one type of charge-neutral
particles is well known to feature the properties of the liquid-gas phase
transition. In this contribution, we address the effect of Coulomb and isospin
dependence interaction for the finite nuclei transition, and study the symmetry
energy properties of finite temperature systems.
