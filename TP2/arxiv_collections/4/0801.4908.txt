The inclusive neutral and charged current deep inelastic scattering processes
at high Q2 provide the main basis for electroweak studies at HERA. These
studies include the determination of the W boson propagator mass and weak
neutral current couplings of light quarks to the Z0 boson. The polarised
electron or positron beam at HERA II gives rise to additional sensitivities for
these studies. Exceptions also exist; this is the case for the single W
production.
