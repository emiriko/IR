The recently proposed reduction method for diluted spin glasses is
investigated in depth. In particular, the Edwards-Anderson model with \pm J and
Gaussian bond disorder on hyper-cubic lattices in d=2, 3, and 4 is studied for
a range of bond dilutions. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of using
bond dilution to elucidate low-temperature properties of Ising spin glasses,
and provide a starting point to enhance the methods used in reduction. Based on
that, a greedy heuristic call ``Dominant Bond Reduction'' is introduced and
explored.
