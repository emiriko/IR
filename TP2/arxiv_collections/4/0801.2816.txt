We report the first measurements and detailed analysis of extreme ultraviolet
(EUV) spectra (4 nm to 20 nm) of highly-charged tungsten ions W$^{54+}$ to
W$^{63+}$ obtained with an electron beam ion trap (EBIT). Collisional-radiative
modelling is used to identify strong electric-dipole and magnetic-dipole
transitions in all ionization stages. These lines can be used for impurity
transport studies and temperature diagnostics in fusion reactors, such as ITER.
Identifications of prominent lines from several W ions were confirmed by
measurement of isoelectronic EUV spectra of Hf, Ta, and Au. We also discuss the
importance of charge exchange recombination for correct description of
ionization balance in the EBIT plasma.
