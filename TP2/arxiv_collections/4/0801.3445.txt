The new approach to the theoretical description of the thermal Casimir force
between real metals is presented. It uses the plasma-like dielectric
permittivity that takes into account the interband transitions of core
electrons. This permittivity precisely satisfies the Kramers-Kronig relations.
The respective Casimir entropy is positive and vanishes at zero temperature in
accordance with the Nernst heat theorem. The physical reasons why the Drude
dielectric function, when substituted in the Lifshitz formula, is inconsistent
with electrodynamics are elucidated. The proposed approach is the single one
consistent with all measurements of the Casimir force performed up to date. The
application of this approach to metal-type semiconductors is considered.
