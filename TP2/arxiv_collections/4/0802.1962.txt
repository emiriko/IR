Torquato and Stillinger have constructed a new family of frustrated lattices
by unusually high dilution of close packed structures while preserving
structural stability. We show that an infinite subclass of these structures has
an underlying topology that greatly simplifies determination of their magnetic
phase structure for nearest neighbor antiferromagnetism interactions and O(N)
spins.
