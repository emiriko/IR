Anisotropic magnetic and electronic transport measurements were carried out
on large single crystals of Fe1-xCoxSb2 (0<= x <=1). The semiconducting state
of FeSb2 evolves into metallic and weakly ferromagnetic by substitution of Fe
with Co for x<0.5. Further doping induces structural transformation from
orthorhombic Pnnm structure of FeSb2 to monoclinic P21/c structure of CoSb2
where semiconducting and diamagnetic ground state is restored again. Large
magnetoresistance and anisotropy in electronic transport were observed.
