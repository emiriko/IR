The effect of strong long-range disorder on the quantization of the Hall
conductivity $\sigma_{xy}$ in graphene is studied numerically. It is shown that
increasing Landau-level mixing progressively destroys all plateaus in
$\sigma_{xy}$ except the plateaus at $\sigma_{xy}=\mp e^2/2h$ (per valley and
per spin). The critical state at the charge-neutral Dirac point is robust to
strong disorder and belongs to the universality class of the conventional
plateau transitions in the integer quantum Hall effect. We propose that the
breaking of time-reversal symmetry by ripples in graphene can realize this
quantum critical point in a vanishing magnetic field.
