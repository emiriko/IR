Accurate atomic mass measurements of neutron-deficient and neutron-rich
nuclides around the doubly-magic 208Pb and of neutron-rich cesium isotopes were
performed with the Penning trap mass spectrometer ISOLTRAP at ISOLDE/CERN. The
masses of 145,147Cs, 181,183Tl, 186Tlm, 187Tl, 196Tlm, 205Tl, 197Pbm, 208Pb,
190 to 197Bi, 209,215,216Bi, 203,205,229Fr, and 214,229,230Ra were determined.
The obtained relative mass uncertainty in the range of $2 \cdot 10^{-7}$ to $2
\cdot 10^{-8}$ is not only required for safe identification of isomeric states
but also allows mapping the detailed structure of the mass surface. A mass
adjustment procedure was carried out and the results included into the Atomic
Mass Evaluation. The resulting separation energies are discussed and the mass
spectrometric and laser spectroscopic data are examined for possible
correlations.
