A three-dimensional (3D) correlation function obtained from mid-rapidity, low
pT pion pairs in central Au+Au collisions at sqrt(s_NN)=200 GeV is studied. The
extracted model-independent source function indicates a long range tail in the
directions of the pion pair transverse momentum (out) and the beam (long).
Model comparisons to these distensions indicate a proper breakup time \tau_0 ~
9 fm/c and a mean proper emission duration \Delta\tau ~ 2 fm/c, leading to
sizable emission time differences
  (<|\Delta \tau_LCM |> ~ 12 fm/c), partly due to resonance decays.
  They also suggest an outside-in "burning" of the emission source reminiscent
of many hydrodynamical models.
