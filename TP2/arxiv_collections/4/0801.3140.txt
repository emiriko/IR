The signal of isospin-asymmetric phase transition in the evolution of the
chemical potential was observed for hot quasi-projectiles produced in the
reactions 40,48Ca + 27Al confirming an analogous observation in the lighter
system 28Si + 112,124Sn. With increasing mass, the properties of hot
quasi-projectiles become increasingly influenced by the secondary emission.
Thermodynamical observables exhibit no sensitivity to the different number of
missing neutrons in the two reactions 40,48Ca + 27Al, thus providing a signal
of dynamical emission of neutrons, which can be related to formation of a very
neutron-rich low-density region (neck) between the projectile and target.
