We investigate quantum dynamics in the electron-nuclei coupled spin system in
quantum dots and clarify the fundamental features of quantum correlation
induced via successive electron spin measurements. This quantum correlation
leads to interesting phenomena such as the bunching of outcomes in the electron
spin measurements and the revival of an arbitrary initial electron spin state.
The nuclear spin system is also affected by the quantum correlation and is in
fact squeezed via conditional measurements or postselection. This squeezing is
confirmed by calculating the increase in the purity of the nuclear spin system.
Thus the successive electron spin measurements provide a probabilistic method
to squeeze the nuclear spin system. These new features are predicted not only
for the case of a double quantum dots occupied by a pair of electrons but also
for the case of a single quantum dot occupied by a single electron or a pair of
electrons.
