Econophysics embodies the recent upsurge of interest by physicists into
financial economics, driven by the availability of large amount of data, job
shortage in physics and the possibility of applying many-body techniques
developed in statistical and theoretical physics to the understanding of the
self-organizing economy. This brief historical survey emphasizes that
Econophysics has many historical precursors, and is in fact rooted in a
continuous cross-fertilization between economics and physics that has been
active in the last centuries.
