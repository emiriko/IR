We study Poisson and operator algebras with the ''quasi-linear property''
from the Heisenberg picture point of view. This means that there exists a set
of one-parameter groups yielding an explicit expression of dynamical variables
(operators) as functions of ''time'' $t$. We show that many algebras with
nonlinear commutation relations such as the Askey-Wilson, $q$-Dolan-Grady and
others satisfy this property. This provides one more (explicit Heisenberg
evolution) interpretation of the corresponding integrable systems.
