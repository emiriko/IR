We develop a microscopic theory of electron transport in superlattices within
the Wannier-Stark approach by including the interaction associated with Zener
tuneling among the energy levels pertaining to adjacent quantum wells. By using
a Monte Carlo technique we have simulated the hopping motion associated with
absorption and emission of polar optical phonons and determined the main
transport parameters for the case of a GaAs/GaAlAs structure at room
temperature. The interaction among the levels is found to be responsible for a
systematic increase of the level energy with respect to the bottom of the
quantum well at electric fields above about 20 kV/cm. When compared with the
non-interacting case, at the highest fields the average carrier energy
evidences a consistent increase which leads to a significant softening of the
negative differential value of both the drift velocity and diffusivity.
