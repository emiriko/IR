We study the production of the charged Higgs boson at the LHC in the
left-right symmetric model. It is shown that there exists a lower bound of the
cross section. We investigate that predicted cross sections of this model are
generally larger than those of the two Higgs doublet model or the minimal
supersymmetric model.
