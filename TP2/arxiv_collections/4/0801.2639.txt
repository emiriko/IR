In this paper we carefully reexamine the various framworks existing in the
field of relativistic thermodynamics. We scrutinize in particular the different
conceptual foundations of notions like the relativistic work, heat force,
moving heat and relativistic temperature. As to the latter notion we argue
that, as in ordinary thermodynamics, relativistic absolute temperature should
be introduced operationally via relativistic Carnot processes. We exhibit the
more implicit or even hidden tacit preassumptions being made and point to a
couple of gaps, errors and inconclusive statements in some of the existing
literature. We show in particular that there is a wide-spread habit to draw
general conclusions from the analysis of too restricted and special
thermodynamic processes, e.g. processes with constant pressure, which is
dangerous and sometimes leads to wrong results. Furthermore, we give a detailed
analysis of the so-called zeroth law of relativistic thermodynamics with the
help of a relativistic Carnot process. We rigorously show that, contrary to
certain statements in the literature, thermodynamic systems at different
relativistic temperatures, moving relative to each other, can thermally stably
coexist provided that their respective temperatures obey a certain functional
relation (given by the Lorentz factor). This implies however that their
respective rest temperatures are the same.
