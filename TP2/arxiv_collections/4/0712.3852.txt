When one deals with data drawn from continuous variables, a histogram is
often inadequate to display their probability density. It deals inefficiently
with statistical noise, and binsizes are free parameters. In contrast to that,
the empirical cumulative distribution function (obtained after sorting the
data) is parameter free. But it is a step function, so that its differentiation
does not give a smooth probability density. Based on Fourier series expansion
and Kolmogorov tests, we introduce a simple method, which overcomes this
problem. Error bars on the estimated probability density are calculated using a
jackknife method. We give several examples and provide computer code
reproducing them. You may want to look at the corresponding figures 4 to 9
first.
