Reduced density matrix functional theory for the case of solids is presented
and a new exchange correlation functional based on a fractional power of the
density matrix is introduced. We show that compared to other functionals, this
produces more accurate results for both finite systems. Moreover, it captures
the correct band gap behavior for conventional semiconductors as well as
strongly correlated Mott insulators, where a gap is obtained in absence of any
magnetic ordering.
