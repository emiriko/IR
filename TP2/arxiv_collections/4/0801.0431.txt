We present a innovative relationship between ground states of the Ising model
and dimer coverings which sheds new light on the Ising Models with highly
degenerated ground states and enables one to construct such models. Thanks to
this relationship we also find the generating function for dimers as the
appropriate limit of the free energy per spin for the Ising model.
