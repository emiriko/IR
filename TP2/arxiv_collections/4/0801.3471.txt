We review black hole solutions of higher-dimensional vacuum gravity, and of
higher-dimensional supergravity theories. The discussion of vacuum gravity is
pedagogical, with detailed reviews of Myers-Perry solutions, black rings, and
solution-generating techniques. We discuss black hole solutions of maximal
supergravity theories, including black holes in anti-de Sitter space. General
results and open problems are discussed throughout.
