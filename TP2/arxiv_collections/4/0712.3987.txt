We prove relations between fractional linear cycles in Bloch's integral
cubical higher Chow complex in codimension two of number fields, which
correspond to functional equations of the dilogarithm.
  These relations suffice, as we shall demonstrate with a few examples, to
write down enough relations in Bloch's integral higher Chow group CH^2(F,3) for
certain number fields F to detect torsion cycles.
  Using the regulator map to Deligne cohomology, one can check the
non-triviality of the torsion cycles thus obtained. Using this combination of
methods, we obtain explicit higher Chow cycles generating the integral motivic
cohomology groups of some number fields.
