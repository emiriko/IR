A new procedure to prepare isomerically clean samples of ions with a mass
resolving power of more than 100,000 has been developed at the JYFLTRAP tandem
Penning trap system. The method utilises a dipolar rf-excitation of the ion
motion with separated oscillatory fields in the precision trap. During a
subsequent retransfer to the purification trap, the contaminants are rejected
and as a consequence, the remaining bunch is isomerically cleaned. This
newly-developed method is suitable for very high-resolution cleaning and is at
least a factor of five faster than the methods used so far in Penning trap mass
spectrometry.
