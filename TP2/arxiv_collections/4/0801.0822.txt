We review and further develop the theory of $E$-orbit functions. They are
functions on the Euclidean space $E_n$ obtained from the multivariate
exponential function by symmetrization by means of an even part $W_{e}$ of a
Weyl group $W$, corresponding to a Coxeter-Dynkin diagram. Properties of such
functions are described. They are closely related to symmetric and
antisymmetric orbit functions which are received from exponential functions by
symmetrization and antisymmetrization procedure by means of a Weyl group $W$.
The $E$-orbit functions, determined by integral parameters, are invariant with
respect to even part $W^{\rm aff}_{e}$ of the affine Weyl group corresponding
to $W$. The $E$-orbit functions determine a symmetrized Fourier transform,
where these functions serve as a kernel of the transform. They also determine a
transform on a finite set of points of the fundamental domain $F^{e}$ of the
group $W^{\rm aff}_{e}$ (the discrete $E$-orbit function transform).
