Quantitative understanding of human behaviors provides elementary
comprehension of the complexity of many human-initiated systems. A basic
assumption embedded in the previous analyses on human dynamics is that its
temporal statistics are uniform and stationary, which can be properly described
by a Poisson process. Accordingly, the interevent time distribution should have
an exponential tail. However, recently, this assumption is challenged by the
extensive evidence, ranging from communication to entertainment and work
patterns, that the human dynamics obeys non-Poisson statistics with
heavy-tailed interevent time distribution. This review article summarizes the
recent empirical explorations on human activity pattern, as well as the
corresponding theoretical models for both task-driven and interest-driven
systems. Finally, we outline some future open questions in the studies of the
statistical mechanics of human dynamics.
