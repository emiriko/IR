Electrical resistivity as a function of temperature, pressure, and magnetic
field was measured in high and low purity single crystals of BaVS$_3$ close to
the critical pressure value $p_{cr}$$\approx$2 GPa, associated with the zero
temperature insulator-to-metal (MI) transition. In the 1.8-2.0 GPa range, where
the MI transition is below $\approx$20 K, one can observe a sudden collapse of
the MI phase boundary upon increasing pressure and at fixed pressure a magnetic
field induced insulator to metal transition. In high quality samples these
features are accompanied by hysteresis in all measured physical quantities as a
function of temperature and magnetic field. We ascribe these observations to
the crossing of the MI and the magnetic phase boundaries upon increasing
pressure.
