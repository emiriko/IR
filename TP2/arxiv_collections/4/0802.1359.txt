This paper presents a novel method to parallel fabricate large area (wafer
scale) metallic nano-split-ring arrays with nanoimprint lithography (NIL). To
our knowledge it is the first method that can pattern large area and high dense
metallic split-ring arrays with advantages of high throughput, low-cost and
simplicity. This method makes metallic nano-split-ring arrays, which was
somehow conceptual before, practically useful. The optical properties of the
fabricated gold nano-split-ring arrays with different parameters were measured.
They show very obvious magnetic response to the incident light (which shows
10dB extinction ration in transmission spectra). The structure fabricated by
this method can generate magnetic response in optical range with relatively
large feature size that relax the requirement of resolution on lithography.
