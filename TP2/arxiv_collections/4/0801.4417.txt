We propose an approach to coherently transfer populations between selected
quantum states in one- and two-qubit systems by using controllable
Stark-chirped rapid adiabatic passages (SCRAPs). These {\it evolution-time
insensitive} transfers, assisted by easily implementable single-qubit
phase-shift operations, could serve as elementary logic gates for quantum
computing. Specifically, this proposal could be conveniently demonstrated with
existing Josephson phase qubits. Our proposal can find an immediate application
in the readout of these qubits. Indeed, the broken parity symmetries of the
bound states in these artificial "atoms" provide an efficient approach to
design the required adiabatic pulses.
