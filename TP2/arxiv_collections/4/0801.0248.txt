We present a realistic supersymmetric SU(5) model combined with a
non-anomalous U(1)_F symmetry. We find a set of U(1)_F charges which
automatically lead to the realistic mass hierarchy and mixing patterns for
quarks, leptons and neutrinos. All gauge anomalies, including the [U(1)_F]^3
anomaly, are cancelled in our model without invoking the Green-Schwarz
mechanism or having exotic fields. Proton decay mediated by dimension 5
operators is automatically suppressed in our model, because the scale set by
the largest right-handed neutrino mass is much less than the GUT scale.
