We construct a simple translationally invariant, nearest-neighbor Hamiltonian
on a chain of 10-dimensional qudits that makes it possible to realize universal
quantum computing without any external control during the computational
process. We only require the ability to prepare an initial computational basis
state which encodes both the quantum circuit and its input. The computational
process is then carried out by the autonomous Hamiltonian time evolution. After
a time polynomially long in the size of the quantum circuit has passed, the
result of the computation is obtained with high probability by measuring a few
qudits in the computational basis. This result also implies that there cannot
exist efficient classical simulation methods for generic translationally
invariant nearest-neighbor Hamiltonians on qudit chains, unless quantum
computers can be efficiently simulated by classical computers (or, put in
complexity theoretic terms, unless BPP=BQP).
