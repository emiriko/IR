We investigate what one can hope to learn about the parameters that describe
the neutrino fluxes emitted by the explosion of a galactic supernova using the
observations of a megaton-size Water-Cherenkov detector. We calculate the
allowed regions that can be obtained by fitting these parameters to a simulated
observation of events by such a detector. All four available detection channels
(inverse beta decay, charge and neutral current on oxygen and elastic
scattering on electrons) are included in the fit and we use a ten dimensional
parameters space. Nine parameters describe the initial neutrino fluxes and are
referred to as the supernova parameters. Furthermore, we include the dependence
on the Chooz mixing angle $\theta_{13}$, which controls the matter effects that
the neutrino undergoes in the outer-parts of the supernova. If we do not make
any extra assumption on these parameters, we show that one can hope to
determine $\theta_{13}$ quite well whereas, except for the parameters
describing the $\bar\nu_e$ flux, most of the supernova parameters are rather
difficult to constrain, even if the four detection channels could be completely
separated.
