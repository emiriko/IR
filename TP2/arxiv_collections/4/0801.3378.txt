Theoretical approach is proposed to description of dielectric properties of
matrix disperse systems which consists of dielectric matrix with embedded in
metallic inclusions. On the basis of effective differential medium
approximation the analytical expressions are obtained for the effective
dielectric permittivity of the matrix disperse system with inclusions of
spherical and ellipsoidal shape. The analysis of limits of possible values of
the real and imaginary parts of is carried out depending on system parameters.
