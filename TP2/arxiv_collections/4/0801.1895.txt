A transition between the strong (coherent) and weak (incoherent) coupling
limits of resonant interaction between quantum well (QW) excitons and bulk
photons is analyzed and quantified as a function of the incoherent damping rate
caused by exciton-phonon and exciton-exciton scattering. For confined QW
polaritons, a second, anomalous, damping-induced dispersion branch arises and
develops with increasing damping. In this case, the strong-weak coupling
transition is attributed to a critical damping rate, when the intersection of
the normal and damping-induced dispersion branches occurs. For the radiative
states of QW excitons, i.e., for radiative QW polaritons, the transition is
described as a qualitative change of the photoluminescence spectrum at grazing
angles along the QW structure. Furthermore, we show that the radiative
corrections to the QW exciton states with in-plane wavevector approaching the
photon cone are universally scaled by an energy parameter rather than diverge.
The strong-weak coupling transition rates are also proportional to the same
energy parameter. The numerical evaluations are given for a GaAs single quantum
well with realistic parameters.
