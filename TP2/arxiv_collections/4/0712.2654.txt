We investigate in detail the model of a trophic web proposed by Amaral and
Meyer [Phys. Rev. Lett. 82, 652 (1999)]. We focused on small-size systems that
are relevant for real biological food webs and for which the fluctuations are
playing an important role. We show, using Monte Carlo simulations, that such
webs can be non-viable, leading to extinction of all species in small and/or
weakly coupled systems. Estimations of the extinction times and survival
chances are also given. We show that before the extinction the fraction of
highly-connected species ("omnivores") is increasing. Viable food webs exhibit
a pyramidal structure, where the density of occupied niches is higher at lower
trophic levels, and moreover the occupations of adjacent levels are closely
correlated. We also demonstrate that the distribution of the lengths of food
chains has an exponential character and changes weakly with the parameters of
the model. On the contrary, the distribution of avalanche sizes of the extinct
species depends strongly on the connectedness of the web. For rather loosely
connected systems we recover the power-law type of behavior with the same
exponent as found in earlier studies, while for densely-connected webs the
distribution is not of a power-law type.
