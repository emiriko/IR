The paper is dealing with semi-classical asymptotics of a characteristic
function for a stochastic process. The main technical tool is provided by the
stationary phase method. The extremal range for a stochastic process is defined
by limit values of the complex logarithm of the characteristic function. The
paper also outlines a numerical method for calculating stochastic extrema.
