We argue that the production of Mueller-Navelet jets at the LHC represents a
convenient environment to study gluon saturation and high energy scattering in
the presence of unitarity corrections. We show that, in a suitable range of
transverse momenta for the produced jets, the cross section for the partonic
subprocess should exhibit geometric scaling. We point out that, in the presence
of a running coupling, the cross section for producing hard jets cannot be
fully computed in perturbation theory, not even after taking into account the
saturation effects: the non-perturbative physics affects the overall
normalization of the cross section, but not also its geometric scaling
behavior.
