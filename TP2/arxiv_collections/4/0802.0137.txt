We investigate a decentralised approach to committing transactions in a
replicated database, under partial replication. Previous protocols either
re-execute transactions entirely and/or compute a total order of transactions.
In contrast, ours applies update values, and orders only conflicting
transactions. It results that transactions execute faster, and distributed
databases commit in small committees. Both effects contribute to preserve
scalability as the number of databases and transactions increase. Our algorithm
ensures serializability, and is live and safe in spite of faults.
