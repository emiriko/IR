In recent work (arXiv:0712.2456, arXiv:0712.2451) the energy-momentum tensor
for the N=4 SYM fluid was computed up to second derivative terms using
holographic methods. The aim of this note is to propose an entropy current
(accurate up to second derivative terms) consistent with this energy-momentum
tensor and to explicate its relation with the existing theories of relativistic
hydrodynamics. In order to achieve this, we first develop a Weyl-covariant
formalism which simplifies the study of conformal hydrodynamics. This naturally
leads us to a proposal for the entropy current of an arbitrary conformal fluid
in any spacetime (with d>3). In particular, this proposal translates into a
definite expression for the entropy flux in the case of N=4 SYM fluid. We
conclude this note by comparing the formalism presented here with the
conventional Israel-Stewart formalism.
