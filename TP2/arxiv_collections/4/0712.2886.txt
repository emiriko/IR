Quasi-particle model of quark gluon plasma is the statistical mechanics of
particles with medium dependent mass, related to plasma frequency, which was
proposed to describe the thermodynamics of the medium itself. At relativistic
limit the plasma frequency depends on number density and temperature. The
number density is a thermodynamic quantity of the medium which in turn depends
on plasma frequency. Hence, one need to solve this problem self-consistently,
instead of using perturbative expressions for plasma frequency. Here we carry
out such a self-consistent calculations using our, recently developed, a new
formulations of quasiparticle model. By adjusting a single parameter for each
system, a remarkably good fit to lattice QCD results are obtained for 2, 3 and
(2+1) flavor quark gluon plasma systems, first, with zero chemical potential.
Then, it is extended to systems with finite chemical potential and fits very
well the lattice results without any new parameter.
