We study the coefficients in the expansion of Jack polynomials in terms of
power sums. We express them as polynomials in the free cumulants of the
transition measure of an anisotropic Young diagram. We conjecture that such
polynomials have nonnegative integer coefficients. This extends recent results
about normalized characters of the symmetric group.
