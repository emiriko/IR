QCD at a finite quark-number chemical potential $\mu$ has a complex fermion
determinant, which precludes its study by standard lattice QCD simulations. We
therefore simulate lattice QCD at finite $\mu$ in the phase-quenched
approximation, replacing the fermion determinant with its magnitude. These
simulations are used to study the finite temperature transition for small
$\mu$,where the position and nature of this transition are expected to be
unchanged by this approximation. We look for the expected critical endpoint for
3-flavour QCD. Here, it had been argued that the critical point at zero $\mu$
would become the critical endpoint at small $\mu$, for quark masses just above
the critical mass. Our simulations indicate that this does not happen, and
there is no such critical endpoint for small $\mu$. We discuss how we might
adapt techniques used for imaginary $\mu$ to improve the signal/noise ratio and
strengthen our conclusions, using results from relatively low statistics
studies.
