Scientists have measured that what we can see of space is about a billion
billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion (10^81) times
the volume of an average human. Inflationary theory suggests that the entirety
of space is vastly larger. Quantum theory suggests that there are very many
different copies of space of the same basic kind as ours (same laws of
physics). String theory further suggests that there may be many different kinds
of space. This whole collection of googolplexes of galaxies within each of
googolplexes of different spaces within each of googols of kinds of space makes
up an enormously vast universe or multiverse or holocosm. Human beings seem to
be an incredibly small part of this universe in terms of physical size. Yet in
other ways, we may still be a very significant part of our vast universe.
