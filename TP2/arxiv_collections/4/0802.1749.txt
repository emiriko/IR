The proposed fast ignition of highly compressed deuterium-tritium (DT)
targets by petawatt lasers requires energy of about 100kJ. To lower the power
of the laser, it is proposed to accomplish fast ignition with two lasers, one
with lower power in the infrared, and a second one with high power in the
visible to ultraviolet region. The infrared laser of lower power shall by its
radiation pressure drive a large current in a less than solid density plasma
placed inside a capillary, while the second high power-shorter wave
length-laser shall ignite at one end of the capillary a magnetic field
supported thermonuclear detonation wave in a blanket made from solid DT along
the outer surface of the capillary. The other end of the capillary, together
with its DT blanket, is stuck in the DT target, where following the compression
of the target the detonation wave ignites the target.
