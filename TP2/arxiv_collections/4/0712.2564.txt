Dendrites formation in the course of crystallization presents very general
phenomenon, which is analyzed in details via the example of ice crystals growth
in deionized water. Neutral molecules of water on the surface are combined into
the double electric layer (DEL) of oriented dipoles; its field reorients
approaching dipoles with observable radio-emission in the range of 150 kHz. The
predominant attraction of oriented dipoles to points of gradients of this field
induces dendrites growth from them, e.g. formation of characteristic form of
snowflakes at free movement of clusters through saturated vapor in atmosphere.
The constant electric field strengthens DELs' field and the growth of
dendrites. Described phenomena should appear at crystallization of various
substances with dipole molecules, features of radio-emission can allow the
monitoring of certain processes in atmosphere and in technological processes.
Crystallization of particles without constant moments can be stimulated by DELs
of another nature with attraction of virtual moments of particles to gradients
of fields and corresponding dendrites formation.
