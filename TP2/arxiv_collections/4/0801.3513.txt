In Scott (2002) and Congdon (2006), a new method is advanced to compute
posterior probabilities of models under consideration. It is based solely on
MCMC outputs restricted to single models, i.e., it is bypassing reversible jump
and other model exploration techniques. While it is indeed possible to
approximate posterior probabilities based solely on MCMC outputs from single
models, as demonstrated by Gelfand and Dey (1994) and Bartolucci et al. (2006),
we show that the proposals of Scott (2002) and Congdon (2006) are biased and
advance several arguments towards this thesis, the primary one being the
confusion between model-based posteriors and joint pseudo-posteriors. From a
practical point of view, the bias in Scott's (2002) approximation appears to be
much more severe than the one in Congdon's (2006), the later being often of the
same magnitude as the posterior probability it approximates, although we also
exhibit an example where the divergence from the true posterior probability is
extreme.
