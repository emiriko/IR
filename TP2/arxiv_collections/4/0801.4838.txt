We give an overview over recent studies on the model of Active Brownian
Motion (ABM) coupled to reservoirs providing free energy which may be converted
into kinetic energy of motion. First, we present an introduction to a general
concept of active Brownian particles which are capable to take up energy from
the source and transform part of it in order to perform various activities. In
the second part of our presentation we consider applications of ABM to ratchet
systems with different forms of differentiable potentials. Both analytical and
numerical evaluations are discussed for three cases of sinusoidal,
staircase-like and Mateos ratchet potentials, also with the additional loads
modeled by tilted potential structure. In addition, stochastic character of the
kinetics is investigated by considering perturbation by Gaussian white noise
which is shown to be responsible for driving the directionality of the
asymptotic flux in the ratchet. This \textit{stochastically driven
directionality} effect is visualized as a strong nonmonotonic dependence of the
statistics of the right versus left trajectories of motion leading to a net
current of particles. Possible applications of the ratchet systems to molecular
motors are also briefly discussed
