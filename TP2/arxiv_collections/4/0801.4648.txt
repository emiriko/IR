The interaction between extratropical cyclones and the underlying boundary
layer has been a topic of recent discussion in papers by Adamson et. al. (2006)
and Beare (2007). Their results emphasise different mechanisms through which
the boundary layer dynamics may modify the growth of a baroclinic cyclone. By
using different sea-surface temperature distributions and comparing the
low-level winds, the differences are exposed and both of the proposed
mechanisms appear to be acting within a single simulation.
