KATRIN is a very large scale tritium-beta-decay experiment to determine the
mass of the neutrino. It is presently under construction at the
Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe, and makes use of the Tritium Laboratory built
there for the ITER project. The combination of a very large retarding-potential
electrostatic-magnetic spectrometer and an intense gaseous molecular tritium
source makes possible a sensitivity to neutrino mass of 0.2 eV, about an order
of magnitude below present laboratory limits. The measurement is kinematic and
independent of whether the neutrino is Dirac or Majorana. The status of the
project is summarized briefly in this report.
