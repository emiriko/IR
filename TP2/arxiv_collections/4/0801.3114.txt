In the spreadsheet error community, both academics and practitioners
generally have ignored the rich findings produced by a century of human error
research. These findings can suggest ways to reduce errors; we can then test
these suggestions empirically. In addition, research on human error seems to
suggest that several common prescriptions and expectations for reducing errors
are likely to be incorrect. Among the key conclusions from human error research
are that thinking is bad, that spreadsheets are not the cause of spreadsheet
errors, and that reducing errors is extremely difficult.
