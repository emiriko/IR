In this paper, we study combinatorial and structural properties of a new
class of finite and infinite words that are 'rich' in palindromes in the utmost
sense. A characteristic property of so-called "rich words" is that all complete
returns to any palindromic factor are themselves palindromes. These words
encompass the well-known episturmian words, originally introduced by the second
author together with X. Droubay and G. Pirillo in 2001. Other examples of rich
words have appeared in many different contexts. Here we present the first
unified approach to the study of this intriguing family of words.
  Amongst our main results, we give an explicit description of the periodic
rich infinite words and show that the recurrent balanced rich infinite words
coincide with the balanced episturmian words. We also consider two wider
classes of infinite words, namely "weakly rich words" and almost rich words
(both strictly contain all rich words, but neither one is contained in the
other). In particular, we classify all recurrent balanced weakly rich words. As
a consequence, we show that any such word on at least three letters is
necessarily episturmian; hence weakly rich words obey Fraenkel's conjecture.
Likewise, we prove that a certain class of almost rich words obeys Fraenkel's
conjecture by showing that the recurrent balanced ones are episturmian or
contain at least two distinct letters with the same frequency.
  Lastly, we study the action of morphisms on (almost) rich words with
particular interest in morphisms that preserve (almost) richness. Such
morphisms belong to the class of "P-morphisms" that was introduced by A. Hof,
O. Knill, and B. Simon in 1995.
