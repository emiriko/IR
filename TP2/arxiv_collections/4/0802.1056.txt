In this work it is shown that 20 canonical amino acids (AAs) within genetic
code appear to be a whole system with strict distinction in Genetic Code Table
(GCT) into some different quantums: 20, 23, 61 amino acid molecules. These
molecules distinction is followed by specific balanced atom number and/or
nucleon number distinctions within those molecules. In this second version two
appendices are added; also a new version of Periodic system of numbers, whose
first verson is given in arXiv:1107.1998 [q-bio.OT].
