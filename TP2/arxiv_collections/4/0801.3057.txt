A recombination radiation line of electron-hole plasma, observed in
electroluminescence spectra of tunneling silicon MOS diodes, has been
investigated at the temperature > 300 K. The internal quantum efficiency of the
luminescence, equal to 0.003, appears to be unexpectedly high. The spectral
position of the luminescence line indicates, that a weak overheating of the
diode by the diode current results in an anomalously strong reduction of the
semiconductor energy gap inside the electron-hole plasma. A unique threshold
optical hysteresis is observed in the luminescence intensity with changing
diode current. These results are explained by condensation of injected
electron-hole plasma into a dense state. A reduction of the semiconductor
energy gap due to generation of phonons by the plasma is discussed as a reason
of the plasma condensation. The plasma condensation is identified as the plasma
self-compression.
