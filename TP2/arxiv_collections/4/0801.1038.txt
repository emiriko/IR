We demonstrate the capabilities of a high temperature measurement set-up
recently developed at our institute. It is dedicated to the characterization of
semiconductor devices and test structures in the temperature range from room
temperature up to 500 degrees C and higher. A detailed description of the
experimental aquipment is given. Its practical use is demonstrated by measuring
temperature-dependent charcteristics of silicon VDMOSFET and IGBT devices as
well as SiC-diodes. For the silicon devices, numerical simulations based on
recently developed high temperature physical models were also performed in
order to gain a deeper understanding of the measured data, together with a
revalidation of the model parameters.
