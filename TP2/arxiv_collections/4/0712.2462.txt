In supersymmetric (SUSY) models with the gravitino being the lightest SUSY
particle (LSP), the SUSY breaking scale (i.e., the gravitino mass) could be
determined by measuring the lifetime of the next-to-lightest SUSY particle
(NLSP). However, for an ultralight gravitino of mass of O(1) eV, which is
favored cosmologically, the determination of the SUSY breaking scale, or the
gravitino mass, is difficult because the NLSP decay length is too short to be
measured directly. Recently we proposed a new determination of the gravitino
mass by measuring a branching fraction of two decay modes of sleptons. In this
paper, we investigate the prospects for determining the gravitino mass at LHC.
For demonstration we take some explicit gauge-mediation models and show that
the gravitino mass can be determined with an accuracy of a few 10% for an
integrated luminosity 10-100 fb^{-1}.
