We use focused-ion-beam milling of a single-crystal Au surface to fabricate a
590-nm-long linear ridge that acts as a surface plasmon nanoresonator.
Cathodoluminescence imaging spectroscopy is then used to excite and image
surface plasmons on the ridge. Principal component analysis reveals distinct
plasmonic modes, which proves confinement of surface-plasmon oscillations to
the ridge. Boundary-element-method calculations confirm that a linear ridge is
able to support highly-localized surface-plasmon modes (mode diameter < 100
nm). The results demonstrate that focused-ion-beam milling can be used in rapid
prototyping of nanoscale single-crystal plasmonic components.
