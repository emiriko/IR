Attempts to grow terbium aluminium garnet (Tb3Al5O12, TAG) by the Czochralski
method lead to crystals of millimeter scale. Larger crystals could not be
obtained. DTA measurements within the binary system showed that TAG melts
incongruently at 1840 deg. C. The perovskite (TbAlO3, TAP) with a congruent
melting point of 1930 deg. C is the most stable phase in this system. The
region for primary crystallization of TAP covers the chemical composition of
TAG and suppresses the primary crystallization of the terbium aluminium garnet.
