A short review on charmed and beauty hadron production in the lepton deep
inelastic scattering off proton, in proton-proton and proton-antiproton
collisions at high energies is presented. It is shown that the existing
theoretical and experimental information on charmed and beauty quark
distributions in a proton is not satisfactory. A some procedure to study these
distributions at LHC energies is suggested.
