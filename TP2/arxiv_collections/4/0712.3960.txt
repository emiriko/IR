We investigate the hole spin-3/2 relaxation process induced by nonadiabatic
stochastic modulations of the instantaneous Luttinger Hamiltonian. The theory
allows to consider fluctuations of both the direction and the magnitude of a
hole wave vector in all regimes of momentum scattering: from
collision-dominated to ballistic.
