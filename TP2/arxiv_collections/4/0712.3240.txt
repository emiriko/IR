The distribution of fitness effects of adaptive mutations remains poorly
understood, both empirically and theoretically. We study this distribution
using a version of Fisher's geometrical model without pleiotropy, such that
each mutation affects only a single trait. We are motivated by the notion of an
organism's chemotype, the set of biochemical reaction constants that govern its
molecular constituents. From physical considerations, we expect the chemotype
to be of high dimension and to exhibit very little pleiotropy. Our model
generically predicts striking cusps in the distribution of the fitness effects
of arising and fixed mutations. It further predicts that a single element of
the chemotype should comprise all mutations at the high-fitness ends of these
distributions. Using extreme value theory, we show that the two cusps with the
highest fitnesses are typically well-separated, even when the chemotype
possesses thousands of elements; this suggests a means to observe these cusps
experimentally. More broadly, our work demonstrates that new insights into
evolution can arise from the chemotype perspective, a perspective between the
genotype and the phenotype.
