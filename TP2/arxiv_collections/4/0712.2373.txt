In this paper we use the experimental data to obtain the polarized parton
distribution functions (PPDFs) in the LO and NLO approximations. The analysis
is based on the Jacobi polynomials expansion of the polarized structure
function (PSF). Our calculations for polarized parton distribution functions
based on the Jacobi polynomials method are in good agreement with the other
theoretical models.
