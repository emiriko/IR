We report on two novel ways for patterning Lithium Niobate (LN) at
submicronic scale by means of focused ion beam (FIB) bombardment. The first
method consists of direct FIB milling on LiNbO3 and the second one is a
combination of FIB milling on a deposited metallic layer and subsequent RIE
(Reactive Ion Etching) etching. FIB images show in both cases homogeneous
structures with well reproduced periodicity. These methods open the way to the
fabrication of photonic crystals on LiNbO3 substrates.
