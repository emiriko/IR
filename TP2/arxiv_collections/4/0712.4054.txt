An explicit convergent iterative solution for the lowest energy state of the
Schroedinger equation with generalized $N$-dimensional Sombrero-shaped
potential is presented. The condition for the convergence of the iteration
procedure and the dependence of the shape of the groundstate wave function on
the parameters are discussed.
