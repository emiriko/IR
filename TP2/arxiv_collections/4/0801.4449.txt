In this paper we consider nodes in network are heterogeneous and the link
between nodes is caused by the potential dynamical demand of the nodes. Such
demand can be measured by gravitation which increases with the heterogeneous
strength of node and decreases with the geographical distance. Based on this,
we propose a new model for spatial network from the view of gravitation. The
model is to maximize the potential dynamical demand of the whole network,
indicating the possible maximal efficiency of the network and the highest
profits that operators may gain. The model can vary its topology by changing
two parameters. A simulation for the Chinese city airline network is completed.
In the end of this article we discuss the significance and advantage of the
heterogeneous nodes.
