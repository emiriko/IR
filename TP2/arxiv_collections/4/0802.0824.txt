We present a study on buckling of colloidal particles, including
experimental, theoretical and numerical developments. Oil-filled thin shells
prepared by emulsion templating show buckling in mixtures of water and ethanol,
due to dissolution of the core in the external medium. This leads to
conformations with a single depression, either axisymmetric or polygonal
depending on the geometrical features of the shells. These conformations could
be theoretically and/or numerically reproduced in a model of homogeneous
spherical thin shells with bending and stretching elasticity, submitted to an
isotropic external pressure.
