By modeling the normal-superfluid boundary in a trapped polarized Fermi gas
as an elastic membrane, we calculate the atomic density profile. For small
trapping anisotropy, we find that the superfluid-normal boundary remains
approximately elliptical, and has an aspect ratio different from that of the
trap. For very prolate clouds the boundary becomes distorted into a
capsule-like shape. We present an analytic explanation of this shape.
