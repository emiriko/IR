We use the method of dimensional reduction to show that a branching polymer
with excluded volume interaction confined between two flat plates has, in the
thermodynamic limit, a confinement free energy and density profile that is the
same as that of an ideal linear polymer with the same number of monomers and
the same monomer-plate interaction potential. Condensation due to branching is
exactly compensated by swelling due to excluded volume interaction.
