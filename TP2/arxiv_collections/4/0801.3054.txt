The measured values for the mixture angles in neutrino oscillations suggest
the existence of a symmetry of interchange of flavor between muon and tau
neutrinos. Using this symmetry we analyzed the minimal seesaw model for
neutrino masses, where the Majorana mass was diagonalized, and it is
demonstrated that the model supports at most 3 CP violation phases and 5 real
masses at high energies. Nevertheless, at low energies, only 4 parameters of
mass and one relative Majorana CP phase remain. Therefore using the
experimental values of the masses square differences, the mixture angles and
the hierarchy, we can determine some parameters of the model but not all. Also
we propose the use of the parameter of baryonic asymmetry of the universe due
to leptogenesis to determine one more phase of the model. Finally we used a
normal hierarchy for the masses of the right handed neutrinos to make an
approximation, that allowed us to completely reconstruct the mass matrix for
left handed neutrinos. In special the value of mee is determined which can be
compared with the results of the neutrinoless double decay beta.
