The Newtonian gravitational constant has still 150 parts per million of
uncertainty. This paper examines the linear and nonlinear equations governing
the rotational dynamics of the torsion gravitational balance. A nonlinear
effect modifying the oscillation period of the torsion gravitational balance is
carefully explored.
