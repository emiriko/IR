Given a set of correlations originating from measurements on a quantum state
of unknown Hilbert space dimension, what is the minimal dimension d necessary
to describes such correlations? We introduce the concept of dimension witness
to put lower bounds on d. This work represents a first step in a broader
research program aiming to characterize Hilbert space dimension in various
contexts related to fundamental questions and Quantum Information applications.
