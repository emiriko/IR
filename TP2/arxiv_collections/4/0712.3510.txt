The simplest supersymmetric model that solves the mu problem and in which the
GUT-scale parameters need not be finely tuned in order to predict the correct
value of the Z boson mass at low scales is the Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric
Standard Model (NMSSM). However, in order that fine tuning be absent, the
lightest CP-even Higgs boson h should have mass ~100 GeV and SM couplings to
gauge bosons and fermions. The only way that this can be consistent with LEP
limits is if h decays primarily via h->aa->4 tau or 4j but not 4b, where a is
the lighter of the two pseudo-scalar Higgses that are present in the NMSSM.
Interestingly, m_a < 2 m_b is natural in the NMSSM with m_a > 2 m_tau somewhat
preferred. Thus, h -> 4 tau becomes a key mode of interest. Meanwhile, all
other Higgs bosons of the NMSSM are typically quite heavy. Detection of any of
the NMSSM Higgs bosons at the LHC in this preferred scenario will be very
challenging using conventional channels. In this paper, we demonstrate that the
h -> aa -> 4 tau decay chain should be visible if the Higgs is produced in the
process pp -> p+h+p with the final state protons being measured using suitably
installed forward detectors. Moreover, we show that the mass of both the h and
the a can be determined on an event-by-event basis.
