We investigate theoretically the effects of interaction between an optical
dipole (semiconductor quantum dot or molecule) and metal nanoparticles. The
calculated absorption spectra of hybrid structures demonstrate strong effects
of interference coming from the exciton-plasmon coupling. In particular, the
absorption spectra acquire characteristic asymmetric lineshapes and strong
anti-resonances. We present here an exact solution of the problem beyond the
dipole approximation and find that the multipole treatment of the interaction
is crucial for the understanding of strongly-interacting exciton-plasmon
nano-systems. Interestingly, the visibility of the exciton resonance becomes
greatly enhanced for small inter-particle distances due to the interference
phenomenon, multipole effects, and electromagnetic enhancement. We find that
the destructive interference is particularly strong. Using our exact theory, we
show that the interference effects can be observed experimentally even in the
exciting systems at room temperature.
