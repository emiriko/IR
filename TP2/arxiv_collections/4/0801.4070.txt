Coalescence of two massive black holes is the strongest and most promising
source for LISA. In fact, gravitational signal from the end of inspiral and
merger will be detectable throughout the Universe. In this article we describe
the first step in the two-step hierarchical search for gravitational wave
signal from the inspiraling massive BH binaries. It is based on the routinely
used in the ground base gravitational wave astronomy method of filtering the
data through the bank of templates. However we use a novel Monte-Carlo based
(stochastic) method to lay a grid in the parameter space, and we use the
likelihood maximized analytically over some parameters, known as F-statistic,
as a detection statistic. We build a coarse template bank to detect
gravitational wave signals and to make preliminary parameter estimation. The
best candidates will be followed up using Metropolis-Hasting stochastic search
to refine the parameter estimation. We demonstrate the performance of the
method by applying it to the Mock LISA data challenge 1B (training data set).
