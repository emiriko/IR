We report magnetization and differential thermal analysis measurements as a
function of pressure accross the martensitic transition in magnetically
superelastic Ni-Mn-In alloys. It is found that the properties of the
martensitic transformation are significantly affected by the application of
pressure. All transition temperatures shift to higher values with increasing
pressure. The largest rate of temperature shift with pressure has been found
for Ni$_{50}$Mn$_{34}$In$_{16}$ as a consequence of its small entropy change at
the transition. Such a strong pressure dependence of the transition temperature
opens up the possibility of inducing the martensitic transition by applying
relatively low hydrostatic pressures.
