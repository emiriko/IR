We report first results on the calculation of NNLO corrections to event shape
distributions in electron-positron annhilation. The corrections are sizeable
for all variables, however their magnitude is substantially different for
different observables. We observe that inclusion of the NNLO corrections yields
a considerably better agreement between theory and experimental data both in
shape and normalisation of the event shape distributions.
