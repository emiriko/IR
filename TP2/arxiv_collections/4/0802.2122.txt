I assume a universe whereby the speed of light and the planck constant are
not constants but instead parameters that vary locally in time-and space. When
describing motion, I am able to derive a modified path integral description at
the quantum level, which offers a natural extension of quantum mechanics. At
the microscopic level, this path integral intuitively describes a physics with
many quantum realities thus leading to a novel concept of manifold of physics,
which can be looked at as a novel action principle. This paradigm reflects the
notion that the observed laws of physics on any given scale are determined by
the underlying distribution of the fundamental parameters (i.e Quantum
Mechanics is just one point on this manifold), thus leading to many possible
physical-law based behaviors. By choosing a Gaussian distribution of the
parameters, a quadratic action term appears in the path-integral, which in
turns leads to a complex classical action (and by continuation a new
description for inertia) at the classical level. In the accompanying manuscript
the classical doublet equation of motion is applied to the Newtonian
gravitation field, and a MOND-like, dark-energy-like, and pioneer-anomaly-like
solutions are derived.
