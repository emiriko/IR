We investigate the effect of quenched spatial disordered hopping rates on the
characteristics of the asymmetric simple exclusion process (ASEP) with open
boundaries both numerically and by extensive simulations. Disorder averages of
the bulk density and current are obtained in terms of various input and output
rates. We study the binary and uniform distributions of disorder. It is
verified that the effect of spatial inhomogeneity is generically to enlarge the
size of the maximal current phase. This is in accordance with the mean field
results obtained by Harris and Stinchcombe. Furthermore, we obtain the
dependence of the current and the bulk density on the characteristics of the
disorder distribution function. It is shown that the impact of disorder
crucially depends on the particle input and out rates. In some situations,
disorder can constructively enhance the current.
