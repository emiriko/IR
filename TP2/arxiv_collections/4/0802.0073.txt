Two numerical strategies based on the Wang-Landau and Lee entropic sampling
schemes are implemented to investigate the first-order transition features of
the 3D bimodal ($\pm h$) random-field Ising model at the strong disorder
regime. We consider simple cubic lattices with linear sizes in the range
$L=4-32$ and simulate the system for two values of the disorder strength: $h=2$
and $h=2.25$. The nature of the transition is elucidated by applying the
Lee-Kosterlitz free-energy barrier method. Our results indicate that, despite
the strong first-order-like characteristics, the transition remains continuous,
in disagreement with the early mean-field theory prediction of a tricritical
point at high values of the random-field.
