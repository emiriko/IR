Recent experiments at RHIC have shown that in 200 GeV Au-Au collisions, the
Lambda and Antilambda hyperons are produced with very small polarizations [1],
almost consistent with zero. These results can be understood in terms of a
model that we recently proposed [2]. In this work, we show how this model may
be applied in such collisions, and also will discuss the relation of our
results with other models, in order to explain the experimental data.
