We study theoretically the charge transport pumped by magnetization dynamics
through epitaxial FIF and FNIF magnetic tunnel junctions (F: Ferromagnet, I:
Insulator, N: Normal metal). We predict a small but measurable DC pumping
voltage under ferromagnetic resonance conditions for collinear magnetization
configurations, which may change sign as function of barrier parameters. A much
larger AC pumping voltage is expected when the magnetizations are at right
angles. Quantum size effects are predicted for an FNIF structure as a function
of the normal layer thickness.
