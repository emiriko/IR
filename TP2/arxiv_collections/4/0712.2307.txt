The local and non-local contents of non-local probability distributions are
studied using the approach of Elitzur, Popescu and Rohrlich [Phys. Lett. A
\textbf{162}, 25 (1992)]. This work focuses on distributions that can be
obtained by single-copy von Neumann measurements on bipartite quantum systems.
For pure two-qubit states Psi(theta)=cos(theta)|00>+sin(theta)|11>, with
cos(theta)>=sin(theta), the local content of the corresponding probability
distribution is found to lie between 1-sin(2*theta) and cos(2*theta). For the
family Psi(gamma)= (|00>+|11>+gamma*|22>)/sqrt(2+gamma^2) of two-qutrit states,
non-zero local content is found for gamma>2.
