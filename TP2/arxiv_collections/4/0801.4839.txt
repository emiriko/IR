We report experiments on the production of ultracold neutrons (UCN) in a
converter of superfluid helium coated with fluorinated grease. We employed our
technique of window-free extraction of accumulated UCN from the helium, in
which they were produced by downscattering neutrons of a cold beam from the
Munich research reactor. The time constant for UCN passage through the same
extraction aperture as in a previous experiment was a factor two shorter,
despite a lower mean velocity of the accumulated UCN in the present
experiments. A time-of-flight measurement of the cold neutron spectrum incident
on the converter allowed us to estimate the multi-phonon contribution to the
UCN production. The UCN production rate inferred from two methods agrees with
the theoretical expectation.
