The human eye can detect optical signals containing only a few photons. We
investigate the possibility to demonstrate entanglement with such biological
detectors. While one person could not detect entanglement by simply observing
photons, we discuss the possibility for several observers to demonstrate
entanglement in a Bell-type experiment, in which standard detectors are
replaced by human eyes. Using a toy model for biological detectors that
captures their main characteristic, namely a detection threshold, we show that
Bell inequalities can be violated, thus demonstrating entanglement. Remarkably,
when the response function of the detector is close to a step function, quantum
non-locality can be demonstrated without any further assumptions. For smoother
response functions, as for the human eye, post-selection is required.
