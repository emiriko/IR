Ab initio gap equation for ^1S_0 pairing in a nuclear slab is solved for the
Argonne v18 NN-potential. The gap function is compared in detail with the one
found previously for the separable form of the Paris potential. The difference
between the two gaps turned out to be about 10%. Dependence of the gap on the
chemical potential mu is analyzed.
