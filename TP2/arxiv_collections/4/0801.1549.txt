We analyze the zero energy solutions, of a two dimensional system which
undergoes a non-radial symmetric, complex potential V(r,$\phi$). By virtue of
the coherent states concept, the localized states are constructed, and the
consequences of the imaginary part of the potential are found both analytically
and schematically.
