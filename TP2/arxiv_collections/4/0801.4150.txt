We describe the e-Science strategy in Venezuela, in particular initiatives by
the Centro Nacional de Calculo Cientifico Universidad de Los Andes (CECALCULA),
Merida, the Universidad de Los Andes (ULA), Merida, and the Instituto
Venezolano de Investigaciones Cientificas (IVIC), Caracas. We present the plans
for the Venezuelan Academic Grid and the current status of Grid ULA supported
by Internet2. We show different web-based scientific applications that are
being developed in quantum chemistry, atomic physics, structural damage
analysis, biomedicine and bioclimate within the framework of the
E-Infrastructure shared between Europe and Latin America (EELA)
