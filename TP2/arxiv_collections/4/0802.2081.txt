We study the thermodynamics associated to topological black hole solutions of
AdS gravity coupled to nonlinear electrodynamics (Born-Infeld) in any
dimension, using a background-independent regularization prescription for the
Euclidean action given by boundary terms which explicitly depend on the
extrinsic curvature (Kounterterms series). A finite action principle leads to
the correct definition of thermodynamic variables as Noether charges, which
satisfy a Smarr-like relation. In particular, for the odd-dimensional case, a
consistent thermodynamic description is achieved if the internal energy of the
system includes the vacuum energy for AdS spacetime.
