Strange quark contributions to neutrino(antineutrino) scattering are
investigated on the nucleon level in the quasi-elastic region. The incident
energy range between 500 MeV and 1.0 GeV is used for the scattering. All of the
physical observable by the scattering are investigated within available
experimental and theoretical results for the strangeness form factors of the
nucleon. In specific, a newly combined data of parity violating electron
scattering and neutrino scattering is exploited. Feasible quantities to be
explored for the strangeness contents are discussed for the application to
neutrino-nucleus scattering.
