This paper describes the behavior of top gated transistors fabricated using
carbon, particularly epitaxial graphene on SiC, as the active material. In the
past decade research has identified carbon-based electronics as a possible
alternative to silicon-based electronics. This enthusiasm was spurred by high
carbon nanotube carrier mobilities. However, nanotube production, placement,
and control are all serious issues. Graphene, a thin sheet of graphitic carbon,
can overcome some of these problems and therefore is a promising new electronic
material. Although graphene devices have been built before, in this work we
provide the first demonstration and systematic evaluation of arrays of a large
number of transistors entirely produced using standard microelectronics
methods. Graphene devices presented feature high-k dielectric, mobilities up to
5000 cm2/Vs and, Ion/Ioff ratios of up to 7, and are methodically analyzed to
provide insight into the substrate properties. Typical of graphene, these
micron-scale devices have negligible band gaps and therefore large leakage
currents.
