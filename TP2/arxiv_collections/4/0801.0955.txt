Using numerical techniques and asymptotic expansions we obtain the phase
diagram of a paradigmatic model of Coulomb frustrated phase separation in
systems with negative short-range compressibility. The transition from the
homogeneous phase to the inhomogeneous phase is generically first order in
isotropic three-dimensional systems except for a critical point. Close to the
critical point, inhomogeneities are predicted to form a BCC lattice with
subsequent transitions to a triangular lattice of rods and a layered structure.
Inclusion of a strong anisotropy allows for second- and first-order transition
lines joined by a tricritical point.
