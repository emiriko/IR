We describe the design of an integrated development environment (IDE) for
PSF. In the software engineering process we used process algebra in the form of
PSF for the specification of the architecture of the IDE. This specification is
refined to a PSF specification of the IDE system as a ToolBus application, by
applying vertical and horizontal implementation techniques. We implemented the
various tools as specified and connected them with a ToolBus script extracted
from the system specification.
