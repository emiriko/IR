An interval edge t-coloring of a graph G is a proper edge coloring of G with
colors 1,2...,t such that at least one edge of G is colored by color
i,i=1,2...,t, and the edges incident with each vertex x are colored by d_{G}(x)
consecutive colors, where d_{G}(x) is the degree of the vertex x in G. For
Mobius ladders the existence of this coloring is proved and all possible
numbers of colors in such colorings are found.
