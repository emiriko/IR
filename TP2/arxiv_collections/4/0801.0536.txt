Fluctuations of chromodynamic fields in the collisionless quark-gluon plasma
are found as a solution of the initial value linearized problem. The plasma
initial state is on average colorless, stationary and homogeneous. When the
state is stable, the initial fluctuations decay exponentially and in the
long-time limit a stationary spectrum of fluctuations is established. For the
equilibrium plasma it reproduces the spectrum which is provided by the
fluctuation-dissipation relation. Fluctuations in the unstable plasma, where
the memory of initial fluctuations is not lost, are also discussed.
