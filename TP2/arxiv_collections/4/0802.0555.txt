We generalize the gauge sector of gauge-mediated supersymmetry breaking to
allow for an arbitrary gauge group with an arbitrary supersymmetric Higgsing.
The sparticle masses are computed to leading order in the gauge coupling. The
generic effect on the MSSM spectrum from additional Higgsed gauge structure is
to increase the sfermion masses relative to the gaugino masses.
