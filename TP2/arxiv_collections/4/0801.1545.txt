We propose that the entanglement of mixed states is characterised properly in
terms of a probability density function $\mathcal{P}_{\rho}(\mathcal{E})$.
There is a need for such a measure since the prevalent measures (such as
\textit{concurrence} and \textit{negativity}) for two qubit systems are rough
benchmarks, and not monotones of each other. Focussing on the two qubit states,
we provide an explicit construction of $\mathcal{P}_{\rho}(\mathcal{E})$ and
show that it is characterised by a set of parameters, of which concurrence is
but one particular combination. $\mathcal{P}_{\rho}(\mathcal{E})$ is manifestly
invariant under $SU(2) \times SU(2)$ transformations. It can, in fact,
reconstruct the state up to local operations - with the specification of at
most four additional parameters. Finally the new measure resolves the
controversy regarding the role of entanglement in quantum computation in NMR
systems.
