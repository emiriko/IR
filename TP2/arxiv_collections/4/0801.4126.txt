We report on non-destructive observation of Rabi oscillations on the Cs clock
transition. The internal atomic state evolution of a dipole-trapped ensemble of
cold atoms is inferred from the phase shift of a probe laser beam as measured
using a Mach-Zehnder interferometer. We describe a single color as well as a
two-color probing scheme. Using the latter, measurements of the collective
pseudo-spin projection of atoms in a superposition of the clock states are
performed and the observed spin fluctuations are shown to be close to the
standard quantum limit.
