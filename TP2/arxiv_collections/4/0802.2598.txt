Utilizing the three-fireball picture within the quark combination model, we
study systematically the charged particle pseudorapidity distributions in both
Au+Au and Cu+Cu collision systems as a function of collision centrality and
energy, $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=$ 19.6, 62.4, 130 and 200 GeV, in full pseudorapidity
range. We find that: (i)the contribution from leading particles to
$dN_{ch}/d\eta$ distributions increases with the decrease of the collision
centrality and energy respectively; (ii)the number of the leading particles is
almost independent of the collision energy, but it does depend on the nucleon
participants $N_{part}$; (iii)if Cu+Cu and Au+Au collisions at the same
collision energy are selected to have the same $N_{part}$, the resulting of
charged particle $dN/d\eta$ distributions are nearly identical, both in the
mid-rapidity particle density and the width of the distribution. This is true
for both 62.4 GeV and 200 GeV data. (iv)the limiting fragmentation phenomenon
is reproduced. (iiv) we predict the total multiplicity and pseudorapidity
distribution for the charged particles in Pb+Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=
5.5$ TeV. Finally, we give a qualitative analysis of the $N_{ch}/<N_{part}/2>$
and $dN_{ch}/d\eta/<N_{part}/2>|_{\eta\approx0}$ as function of $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$
and $N_{part}$ from RHIC to LHC.
