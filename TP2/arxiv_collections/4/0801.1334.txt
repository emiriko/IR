In the coming year, the Large Hadron Collider will begin colliding protons at
energies nearly an order of magnitude beyond the current frontier. The LHC
will, of course, provide unprecedented opportunities to discover new particle
physics. Less well-known, however, is that the LHC may also provide insights
about gravity and the early universe. I review some of these connections,
focusing on the topics of dark matter and dark energy, and highlight
outstanding prospects for breakthroughs at the interface of particle physics
and cosmology.
