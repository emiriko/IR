We search for the radiative penguin decays B_s to phi gamma and B_s to gamma
gamma in a 23.6 fb-1 data sample collected at the Upsilon(5S) resonance with
the Belle detector at the KEKB e+e- asymmetric-energy collider. We observe for
the first time a radiative penguin decay of the B_s meson in the B_s to phi
gamma mode. No significant B_s to gamma gamma signal is observed.
