We derive the nonequilibrium transient state work fluctuation theorem and
also the Jarzynski equality for a classical harmonic oscillator linearly
coupled to a harmonic heat bath, which is dragged by an external agent.
Coupling with the bath makes the dynamics not only dissipative but also
non-Markovian in general. Since we do not assume anything about the spectral
nature of the harmonic bath the derivation is not only restricted to the
Markovian bath rather it is more general, for a non-Markovian bath.
