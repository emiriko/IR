We observe magnetic trapping of atomic nitrogen (14^N) and cotrapping of
ground state imidogen (14^NH, X-triplet-Sigma-). Both are loaded directly from
a room temperature beam via buffer gas cooling. We trap approximately 1 * 10^11
14^N atoms at a peak density of 5 * 10^11 cm^-3 at 550 mK. The 12 +5/-3 s 1/e
lifetime of atomic nitrogen in the trap is limited by elastic collisions with
the helium buffer gas. Cotrapping of 14^N and 14^NH is accomplished, with 10^8
NH trapped molecules at a peak density of 10^8 cm^-3. We observe no spin
relaxation of nitrogen in collisions with helium.
