Within the framework of the kinetic energy driven superconducting mechanism,
the effect of the extended impurity scatterers on the quasiparticle transport
of cuprate superconductors in the superconducting state is studied based on the
nodal approximation of the quasiparticle excitations and scattering processes.
It is shown that there is a cusplike shape of the energy dependent microwave
conductivity spectrum. At low temperatures, the microwave conductivity
increases linearly with increasing temperatures, and reaches a maximum at
intermediate temperature, then decreases with increasing temperatures at high
temperatures. In contrast with the dome shape of the doping dependent
superconducting gap parameter, the minimum microwave conductivity occurs around
the optimal doping, and then increases in both underdoped and overdoped
regimes.
