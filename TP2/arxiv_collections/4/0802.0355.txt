Non-commutativity of spacetime at the Planck scale may deform the usual
dispersion relations. And these deformed dispersion relations could lead to the
accelerating phase without a scalar field. In this paper, we have calculated
the spectral index and the running of spectral index in a non-commutative
inflation model. Non-commutative inflation with thermal radiation gives a scale
invariant spectrum in the limit $w \to -1$ and negative running spectral index
which are consistent with the WMAP 3-year results.
