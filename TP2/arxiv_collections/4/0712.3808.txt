Nuclear fission of several neutron-deficient actinides and pre-actinides from
excitation energies around 11 MeV was studied at GSI Darmstadt by use of
relativistic secondary beams. The characteristics of multimodal fission of
nuclei around 226Th are systematically investigated and interpreted as the
superposition of three fission channels. Properties of these fission channels
have been determined for 15 systems. A global view on the properties of fission
channels including previous results is presented. The positions of the
asymmetric fission channels are found to be constant in element number over the
whole range of systems investigated.
