We provide a check of the accuracy of the auxiliary field formalism used to
derive the Effective Hamiltonian for baryons in the Field Correlator Method. To
this end we compare the solutions for the Effective Hamiltonian with those
obtained from the solution of the Salpeter equation. Comparing these results
gives a first estimate of the systematic uncertainty due to the use of the
auxiliary field formalism for baryons.
