The parallel-tempering method has been applied to numerically study the
thermodynamic behavior of a three-dimensional disordered antiferromagnetic
Ising model with random fields at spin concentrations corresponding to regions
of both weak and strong structural disorder. An analysis of the low-temperature
behavior of the model convincingly shows that in the case of a weakly
disordered samples there is realized an antiferromagnetic ordered state, while
in the region of strong structural disorder the effects of random magnetic
fields lead to the realization of a new phase state of the system with a
complex domain structure consisting of antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic
domains separated by regions of a spin-glass phase and characterized by a
spinglass ground state.
