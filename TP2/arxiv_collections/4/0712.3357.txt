We study the superconducting transition temperature, T_c, of an array of
fluctuating, maximally gapped interacting ladders, embedded in a disordered
plane. Renormalization group analysis indicates that geometrical fluctuations
mitigate the suppression of the intra-ladder pairing correlations by the
disorder. In addition, the fluctuations enhance the Josephson tunneling between
the ladders. Both effects lead to an increase of T_c in the Josephson coupled
array. These findings may be relevant to the understanding of the 1/8 anomaly
in the lanthanum based high-temperature superconductors.
