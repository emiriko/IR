As laboratory experiments for the detection of particles with non-zero rest
masses forming the dark matter do not give positive results we offer once more
to turn the attention upon the neutrinos background of the Universe. If the
neutrinos background has the temperature 2 K, then direct observations of
particles are impossible ones and only their high density allows hope for the
success indirect observations. In consequence of this the field theory is
constructed as the maximum plausible reduction of the Feynman formulation of
the quantum theory displaying experiment data adequately.
