In a previous work the concept of quantum potential is generalized into
extended phase space (EPS) for a particle in linear and harmonic potentials. It
was shown there that in contrast to the Schr\"odinger quantum mechanics by an
appropriate extended canonical transformation one can obtain the Wigner
representation of phase space quantum mechanics in which the quantum potential
is removed from dynamical equation. In other words, one still has the form
invariance of the ordinary Hamilton-Jacobi equation in this representation. The
situation, mathematically, is similar to the disappearance of the centrifugal
potential in going from the spherical to the Cartesian coordinates. Here we
show that the Husimi representation is another possible representation where
the quantum potential for the harmonic potential disappears and the modified
Hamilton-Jacobi equation reduces to the familiar classical form. This happens
when the parameter in the Husimi transformation assumes a specific value
corresponding to $Q$-function.
