We view Digital Ecosystems to be the digital counterparts of biological
ecosystems, exploiting the self-organising properties of biological ecosystems,
which are considered to be robust, self-organising and scalable architectures
that can automatically solve complex, dynamic problems. Digital Ecosystems are
a novel optimisation technique where the optimisation works at two levels: a
first optimisation, migration of agents (representing services) which are
distributed in a decentralised peer-to-peer network, operating continuously in
time; this process feeds a second optimisation based on evolutionary computing
that operates locally on single peers and is aimed at finding solutions to
satisfy locally relevant constraints. We created an Ecosystem-Oriented
Architecture of Digital Ecosystems by extending Service-Oriented Architectures
with distributed evolutionary computing, allowing services to recombine and
evolve over time, constantly seeking to improve their effectiveness for the
user base. Individuals within our Digital Ecosystem will be applications
(groups of services), created in response to user requests by using
evolutionary optimisation to aggregate the services. These individuals will
migrate through the Digital Ecosystem and adapt to find niches where they are
useful in fulfilling other user requests for applications. Simulation results
imply that the Digital Ecosystem performs better at large scales than a
comparable Service-Oriented Architecture, suggesting that incorporating ideas
from theoretical ecology can contribute to useful self-organising properties in
digital ecosystems.
