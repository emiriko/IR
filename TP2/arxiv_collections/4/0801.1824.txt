The time evolution of plane waves in the presence of a 1-dimensional square
quantum barrier is considered. Comparison is made between the cases of an
infinite and a cut-off (shutter) initial plane wave. The difference is relevant
when the results are applied to the analysis of the tunnelling regime. This
work is focused on the analytical calculation of the time-evolved solution and
highlights the contribution of the resonant (Gamow) states.
