Realization of controllable interaction between distant qubits is one of the
major problems in scalable solid state quantum computing. We study a
superconducting transmission line resonator (TLR) as a tunable dispersive
coupler for the double-dot molecules. A general interaction Hamiltonian of $n$
two-electron spin-based qubits and the TLR is presented, where the double-dot
qubits are biased at the large detuning region and the TLR is always empty and
virtually excited. Our analysis o the main decoherence sources indicates that
various major quantum operations can be reliably implemented with current
technology.
