We show a similarity between two different classical simulation methods for
measurement based quantum computation -- one relying on a low entanglement
(tree tensor network) representation of the computer's state, and the other a
tensor contraction method based on the topology of the graph state. We use this
similarity to show that any quantum circuit that can be efficiently simulated
via tensor contraction cannot produce much entanglement.
