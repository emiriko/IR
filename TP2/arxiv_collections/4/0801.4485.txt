Critical temperature Tc for the nuclear liquid-gas phase transition is
stimated both from the multifragmentation and fission data. In the first
case,the critical temperature is obtained by analysis of the IMF yields in
p(8.1 GeV)+Au collisions within the statistical model of multifragmentation
(SMM). In the second case, the experimental fission probability for excited
188Os is compared with the calculated one with Tc as a free parameter. It is
concluded for both cases that the critical temperature is higher than 16 MeV.
