Single crystals of R$_2$CoGa$_8$ series of compounds were grown, for the
first time, by high temperature solution growth (flux) method. These compounds
crystallize in a tetragonal crystal structure with the space group $P4/mmm$. It
has been found that R$_2$CoGa$_8$ phase forms only with the heavier rare
earths, starting from Gd with a relatively large $c/a$ ratio of $\approx$ 2.6.
The resultant anisotropic magnetic properties of the compounds were
investigated along the two principal crystallographic directions of the crystal
viz., along [100] and [001]. The nonmagnetic compounds Y$_2$CoGa$_8$ and
Lu$_2$CoGa$_8$ show diamagnetic behavior down to the lowest temperature (1.8 K)
pointing out the non-magnetic nature of Co in these compounds and a relatively
low density of electronic states at the Fermi level. Compounds with the
magnetic rare earths order antiferromagnetically at temperatures lower than 30
K. The easy axis of magnetization for R$_2$CoGa$_8$ (R = Tb, Dy and Ho) is
found to be along the [001] direction and it changes to [100] direction for
Er$_2$CoGa$_8$ and Tm$_2$CoGa$_8$. The magnetization behavior is analyzed on
the basis of crystalline electric field (CEF) model. The estimated crystal
field parameters explains the magnetocrystalline anisotropy in this series of
compounds.
