The study of strangeness production at LHC will bring significant information
on the bulk chemical properties, its dynamics and the hadronisation mechanisms
involved at these energies. The ALICE experiment will measure strange particles
from topology (secondary vertices) and from resonance decays over a wide range
in transverse momentum and shed light on this new QCD regime. These motivations
will be presented as well as the identification performance of ALICE for
strange hadrons.
