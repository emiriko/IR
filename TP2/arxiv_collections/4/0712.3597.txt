Neutral atoms interact through a van der Waals potential which asymptotically
falls off as r^{-6}. In ultracold gases, this interaction can be described to a
good approximation by the atom-atom scattering length. However, corrections
arise that depend on the characteristic length of the van der Waals potential.
We parameterize these corrections by analyzing the energies of two- and
few-atom systems under external harmonic confinement, obtained by numerically
and analytically solving the Schrodinger equation. We generalize our results to
particles interacting through a longer-ranged potential which asymptotically
falls off as r^{-4}.
