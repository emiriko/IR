In this contribution, we propose a generic online (also sometimes called
adaptive or recursive) version of the Expectation-Maximisation (EM) algorithm
applicable to latent variable models of independent observations. Compared to
the algorithm of Titterington (1984), this approach is more directly connected
to the usual EM algorithm and does not rely on integration with respect to the
complete data distribution. The resulting algorithm is usually simpler and is
shown to achieve convergence to the stationary points of the Kullback-Leibler
divergence between the marginal distribution of the observation and the model
distribution at the optimal rate, i.e., that of the maximum likelihood
estimator. In addition, the proposed approach is also suitable for conditional
(or regression) models, as illustrated in the case of the mixture of linear
regressions model.
