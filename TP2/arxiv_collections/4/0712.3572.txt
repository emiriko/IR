Experimental program review in our field may benefit from a more quantitative
framework within which to quantitatively discuss the scientific merit of a
proposed program of research, and to assess the scientific merit of a
particular experimental result. This article proposes explicitly such a
quantitative framework. Examples of the use of this framework in assessing the
scientific merit of particular avenues of research at the energy frontier in
many cases provide results in stark contradiction to accepted wisdom. The
experimental scientific figure of merit proposed here has the potential for
informing future choices of research direction in our field, and in other
subfields of the physical sciences.
