The LHC will deliver unexplored energy regimes for proton-proton and
heavy-ion collisions. As shown by the RHIC experiments, particle identification
over a large momentum range is essential to disentangle physics processes,
especially in the intermediate p$_T$ (1 $<p_{T}<5$ GeV/c) region. The novel
design of the High-Momentum Particle Identification Detector (HMPID), based on
large surface CsI photocathodes, is able to identify $\pi^{\pm}$, $K^{\pm}$,
$p$ and $\bar{p}$ in the momentum region where bulk medium properties and hard
scatterings interplay. Furthermore, measurement of resonance particles such as
the $\phi \to K^+K^-$ could provide information on the system evolution. The
HMPID layout and segmentation are optimized to study particle correlations at
high momenta describing the early phase and the dynamical evolution of the
collision. At LHC, the increased hard cross section will significantly be
enhanced compared to RHIC. Jet reconstruction via Deterministic Annealing can
address jet quenching and detailed measurements of jet properties. In this
paper, we present these selected topics from the possible HMPID contributions
to the physics goals of LHC.
