Established results for the quark propagator in Landau gauge QCD, together
with a detailed comparison to lattice data, are used to formulate a Poincare
covariant Faddeev approach to the nucleon. The resultant three-quark amplitudes
describe the quark core of the nucleon. The nucleon's mass and its
electromagnetic form factors are calculated as functions of the current quark
mass. The corresponding results together with charge radii and magnetic moments
are discussed in connection with the contributions from various ingredients in
a consistent calculation of nucleon properties, as well as the role of the pion
cloud in such an approach.
