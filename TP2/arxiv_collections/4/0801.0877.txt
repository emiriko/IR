We present the results of a search for the production of an excited state of
the electron, e*, in proton-antiproton collisions at sqrt(s) = 1.96 TeV. The
data were collected with the D0 experiment at the Fermilab Tevatron Collider
and correspond to an integrated luminosity of approximately 1 fb^-1. We search
for e* in the process ppbar -> e* e, with the e* subsequently decaying to an
electron plus photon. No excess above the standard model background is
observed. Interpreting our data in the context of a model that describes e*
production by four-fermion contact interactions and e* decay via electroweak
processes, we set 95% C.L. upper limits on the production cross section ranging
from 8.9 fb to 27 fb, depending on the mass of the excited electron. Choosing
the scale for contact interactions to be Lambda = 1 TeV, excited electron
masses below 756 GeV are excluded at the 95% C.L.
