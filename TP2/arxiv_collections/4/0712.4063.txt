We investigate the distribution of zeros of the partition function of the
two- and three-dimensional symmetric $\pm J$ Ising spin glasses on the complex
field plane. We use the method to analytically implement the idea of numerical
transfer matrix which provides us with the exact expression of the partition
function as a polynomial of fugacity. The results show that zeros are
distributed in a wide region in the complex field plane. Nevertheless we
observe that zeros on the imaginary axis play dominant roles in the critical
behaviour since zeros on the imaginary axis are in closer proximity to the real
axis. We estimate the density of zeros on the imaginary axis by an
importance-sampling Monte Carlo algorithm, which enables us to sample very rare
events. Our result suggests that the density has an essential singularity at
the origin. This observation is consistent with the existence of Griffiths
singularities in the present systems. This is the first evidence for Griffiths
singularities in spin glass systems in equilibrium.
