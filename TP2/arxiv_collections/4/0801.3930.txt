The first generation of European e-passports will be issued in 2006. We
discuss how borders are crossed regarding the security and privacy erosion of
the proposed schemes, and show which borders need to be crossed to improve the
security and the privacy protection of the next generation of e-passports. In
particular we discuss attacks on Basic Access Control due to the low entropy of
the data from which the access keys are derived, we sketch the European
proposals for Extended Access Control and the weaknesses in that scheme, and
show how fundamentally different design decisions can make e-passports more
secure.
