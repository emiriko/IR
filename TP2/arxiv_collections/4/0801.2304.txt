Recent advances in the description of electromagnetic two-nucleon knockout
reactions are reviewed. The sensitivity to different types of correlations and
to their treatment in the nuclear wave functions, the effects of final-state
interactions and the role of center-of-mass effects in connection with the
problem of the lack of orthogonality between initial bound states and final
scattering states obtained by the use of an energy-dependent optical-model
potential are discussed. Results are presented for proton-proton and
proton-neutron knockout off 16O also in comparison with the available data.
