Deoxyribonucleic acid is increasingly being understood to be an informational
molecule, capable of information processing.It has found application in the
determination of non-deterministic algorithms and in the design of molecular
computing devices. This is a theoretical analysis of the mathematical
properties and relations of the molecules which constituting DNA, which
explains in part why DNA is a successful computing molecule.
