The evolution of breaking waves propagating towards the shore and more
specifically the run-up phase over the swash-zone for surface as well as for
internal waves is considered. The study is based on a) laboratory run up
experiments for surface waves ; b) laboratory stratified flow experiments and
c) on field data describing the internal wave run up. The presentation is
focused on the breaking and energy transfer mechanisms common to surface and
internal waves in the swash-zone. The mathematical model taking into account
turbulent mixing and dispersion effects is discussed.
