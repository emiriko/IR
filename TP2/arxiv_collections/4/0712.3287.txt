The paper studies the relationship between diffraction and dynamics for
uniformly discrete ergodic point processes in real spaces. This relationship
takes the form of an isometric embedding of two L^2 spaces. Diffraction (or
equivalently the 2-point correlations) usually cannot determine the dynamics
entirely, but we prove that knowledge of all the higher correlations (2-point,
3-point, ...) does. A square-mean form of the Bombieri-Taylor conjecture is
proved. A quantitative relation between autocorrelation, diffraction, and
epsilon dual characters is derived. Most results of the paper are proved in the
setting of multi-colour points and assignable scattering strengths.
