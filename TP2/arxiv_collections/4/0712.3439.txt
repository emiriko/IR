We use a wave functional approach to calculate the fidelity of ground states
in the Luttinger liquid universality class of one-dimensional gapless quantum
many-body systems. The ground-state wave functionals are discussed using both
the Schrodinger (functional differential equation) formulation and a path
integral formulation. The fidelity between Luttinger liquids with Luttinger
parameters K and K' is found to decay exponentially with system size, and to
obey the symmetry F(K,K')=F(1/K,1/K') as a consequence of a duality in the
bosonization description of Luttinger liquids.
