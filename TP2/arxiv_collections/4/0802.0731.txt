We studied the dynamic magnetic properties of plane periodical arrays of
circular permalloy nano-dots fabricated using a self-organized mask formed by
polysterene nanospheres on the surface of a Permalloy film. Conventional
(microwave cavity) and broadband coplanar-line ferromagnetic resonance setups
were used for the measurements. We found several well resolved resonance peaks.
This result shows that the self-organized mask fabrication technique is able to
produce high-quality samples with small dispersion of geometrical and magnetic
parameters.
