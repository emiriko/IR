In this paper we explore the effect of non-unitary neutrino mixing on
neutrino oscillation probabilities both in vacuum and matter. In particular, we
consider the $\nu_\mu \to \nu_\tau$ channel and using a Neutrino Factory as the
source for $\nu_\mu$'s discuss the constraints that can be obtained on the
moduli and phases of the parameters characterizing the violation of unitarity.
We point out how the new CP violation phases present in the case where the
non-unitary mixings give rise to spurious ``degenerate'' solutions in the
parameter space and discuss how the true solutions can be extricated by
combining measurements at several baselines.
