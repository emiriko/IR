A family of high rate quantum error correcting codes adapted to the amplitude
damping channel is presented. These codes are nonadditive and exploit
self-complementarity structure to correct all first-order errors. Their rates
can be higher than 1/2. The recovery operations of these codes can be generated
by a simple algorithm and have a projection nature, which makes them
potentially easy to implement.
