The assisted tunneling of a metastable state between barriers is investigated
analytically by means of a simplified one dimensional model. A time dependent
perturbation changes the pole spectrum of the wave function introducing a
larger decay constant. New insights about the decay of a metastable state are
found. The scheme is exemplified for parameters corresponding to the nuclear
process of $\alpha$ decay.
