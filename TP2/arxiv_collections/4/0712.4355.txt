Light is shed on the early stage in the birth of Yukawa's meson theory,
particularly on the interplay between Yukawa and Tomonaga in 1933. The
discovery of the muon by Nishina' group in 1937 is also reviewed. It is pointed
out that Heisenberg's attempt to explain the nuclear force in terms of the
Heitler-London scheme, overcome by Yukawa and abandoned since then, is now
being revived as a mechanism for a super strong nuclear force caused by a
migrating real Kbar meson.
