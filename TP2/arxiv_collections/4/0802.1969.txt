We study quasi-ballistic heat transfer through air between a hot
nanometer-scale tip and a sample. The hot tip/surface configuration is widely
used to perform nonintrusive confined heating. Using a Monte-Carlo simulation,
we find that the thermal conductance reaches 0.8 MW.m-2K-1 on the surface under
the tip and show the shape of the heat flux density distribution
(nanometer-scale thermal spot). These results show that a surface can be
efficiently heated locally without contact. The temporal resolution of the heat
transfer is a few tens of picoseconds.
