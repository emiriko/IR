The scalar mesons f0(1370), f0(1500) and f0(1710) are of interest as there is
as yet no consensus of their status, or indeed of the existence of the
f0(1370). Radiative decays to rho and omega have been shown to provide
effective probes of their structure and to discriminate among models.
Scalar-meson photoproduction is proposed as an alternative and it is shown that
it represents a feasible approach.
