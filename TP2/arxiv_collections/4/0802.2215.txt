We describe in detail the calculation of the two-loop corrections to the QED
Bhabha scattering cross section due to the vacuum polarization by heavy
fermions. Our approach eliminates one mass scale from the most challenging part
of the calculation and allows us to obtain the corrections in a closed
analytical form. The result is valid for arbitrary values of the heavy fermion
mass and the Mandelstam invariants, as long as s,t,u >> m_e^2.
