In this article we discuss a new Hamiltonian PDE arising from a class of
equations appearing in the study of magma, partially molten rock, in the
Earth's interior. Under physically justifiable simplifications, a scalar,
nonlinear, degenerate, dispersive wave equation may be derived to describe the
evolution of $\phi$, the fraction of molten rock by volume, in the Earth. These
equations have two power nonlinearities which specify the constitutive
realitions for bulk viscosity and permeability in terms of $\phi$. Previously,
they have been shown to admit solitary wave solutions. For a particular
relation between exponents, we observe the equation to be Hamiltonian; it can
be viewed as a generalization of the Benjamin-Bona-Mahoney equation.
  We prove that the solitary waves are nonlinearly stable, by showing that they
are constrained local minimizers of an appropriate time-invariant Lyapunov
functional. A consequence is an extension of the regime of global in time
well-posedness for this class of equations to (large) data, which include a
neighborhood of a solitary wave. Finally, we observe that these equations have
{\it compactons}, solitary traveling waves with compact spatial support at each
time.
