This article is expository in nature, outlining some of the many still
incompletely understood features of higher spin field theory. We are mainly
considering higher spin gauge fields in their own right as free-standing
theoretical constructs and not circumstances where they occur as part of
another system. Considering the problem of introducing interactions among
higher spin gauge fields, there has historically been two broad avenues of
approach. One approach entails gauging a non-Abelian global symmetry algebra,
in the process making it local. The other approach entails deforming an already
local but Abelian gauge algebra, in the process making it non-Abelian. In cases
where both avenues have been explored, such as for spin 1 and 2 gauge fields,
the results agree (barring conceptual and technical issues) with Yang-Mills
theory and Einstein gravity. In the case of an infinite tower of higher spin
gauge fields, the first approach has been thoroughly developed and explored by
M. Vasiliev, whereas the second approach, after having lain dormant for a long
time, has received new attention by several authors lately. In the present
paper we briefly review some aspects of the history of higher spin gauge fields
as a backdrop to an attempt at comparing the gauging vs. deforming approaches.
A common unifying structure of strongly homotopy Lie algebras underlying both
approaches will be discussed. The modern deformation approach, using BRST-BV
methods, will be described as far as it is developed at the present time. The
first steps of a formulation in the categorical language of operads will be
outlined. A few aspects of the subject that seems not to have been thoroughly
investigated are pointed out.
