The superconducting gap - an energy scale tied to the superconducting
phenomena-opens on the Fermi surface at the superconducting transition
temperature (TC) in conventional BCS superconductors. Quite differently, in
underdoped high-TC superconducting cuprates, a pseudogap, whose relation to the
superconducting gap remains a mystery, develops well above TC. Whether the
pseudogap is a distinct phenomenon or the incoherent continuation of the
superconducting gap above TC is one of the central questions in high-TC
research. While some experimental evidence suggests they are distinct, this
issue is still under intense debate. A crucial piece of evidence to firmly
establish this two-gap picture is still missing: a direct and unambiguous
observation of a single-particle gap tied to the superconducting transition as
function of temperature. Here we report the discovery of such an energy gap in
underdoped Bi2212 in the momentum space region overlooked in previous
measurements. Near the diagonal of Cu-O bond direction (nodal direction), we
found a gap which opens at TC and exhibits a canonical (BCS-like) temperature
dependence accompanied by the appearance of the so-called Bogoliubov
quasiparticles, a classical signature of superconductivity. This is in sharp
contrast to the pseudogap near the Cu-O bond direction (antinodal region)
measured in earlier experiments. The emerging two-gap phenomenon points to a
picture of richer quantum configurations in high temperature superconductors.
