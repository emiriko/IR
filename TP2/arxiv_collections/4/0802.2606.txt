Based on two different iteration procedures the groundstate wave functions
and energies for N-dimensional generalized Sombrero-shaped potentials are
solved. Two kinds of trial functions for the iteration procedure are defined.
The iterative solutions are convergent nicely to consistent results for
different choices of iteration procedures and trial functions.
