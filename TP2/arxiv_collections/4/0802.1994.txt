We have computed the complete one-loop electroweak effects in the MSSM for
single top (and single antitop) production in the $t$-channel at hadron
colliders, generalizing a previous analysis performed for the dominant $dt$
final state and fully including QED effects. The results are quite similar for
all processes. The overall Standard Model one-loop effect is small, of the few
percent size. This is due to a compensation of weak and QED contributions that
are of opposite sign. The genuine SUSY contribution is generally quite modest
in the mSUGRA scenario. The experimental observables would therefore only
practically depend, in this framework, on the CKM $Wtb$ coupling.
