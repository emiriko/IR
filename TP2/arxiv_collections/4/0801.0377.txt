We report diffusion quantum Monte Carlo calculations of three-dimensional
Wigner crystals in the density range r_s=100-150. We have tested different
types of orbital for use in the approximate wave functions but none improve
upon the simple Gaussian form. The Gaussian exponents are optimized by directly
minimizing the diffusion quantum Monte Carlo energy. We have carefully
investigated and sought to minimize the potential biases in our Monte Carlo
results. We conclude that the uniform electron gas undergoes a transition from
a ferromagnetic fluid to a body-centered-cubic Wigner crystal at r_s=106+/-1.
The diffusion quantum Monte Carlo results are compared with those from
Hartree-Fock and Hartree theory in order to understand the role played by
exchange and correlation in Wigner crystals. We also study "floating" Wigner
crystals and give results for their pair-correlation functions.
