In the present contribution we extend our previous work by considering the
coset space dimensional reduction of higher-dimensional Einstein--Yang--Mills
theories including scalar fluctuations as well as Kaluza--Klein excitations of
the compactification metric and we describe the gravity-modified rules for the
reduction of non-abelian gauge theories.
