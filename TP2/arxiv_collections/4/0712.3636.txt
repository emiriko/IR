To characterise (inter)diffusion in materials, concentration profiles can be
measured by EDX. It allows one to determine the chemical composition with a
very good accuracy if measurement artefacts are accounted for. Standard
phenomena (such as X-ray fluorescence) are usually corrected by commercial
software. However, the effect of the pear-shaped volume of X-ray emission on
the concentration profiles has to be considered. The paper describes the origin
of this artefact, its consequences on measurements and will provide a practical
solution (based on signal processing methods) to deconvolute the actual
concentration profiles (or the diffusion coefficient) from the raw
measurements.
