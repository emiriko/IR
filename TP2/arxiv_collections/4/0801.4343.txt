We compare axial charges of excited nucleons, as predicted by the chiral
symmetry restoration picture, with the traditional, moderately successful for
the ground-state baryons SU(6) symmetry. The axial charges of excited nucleons
can (and will) be measured in lattice QCD simulations, and comparison of the
lattice results with the two different symmetry schemes will give an insight on
the origins of the excited hadron masses as well as on interrelations of chiral
symmetry and confinement.
