We present a detailed analytical and numerical analysis of the inelastic
coherent backscattering spectrum of laser light incident on cold atoms. We
identify frequency domains where the interference contribution can be positive
\emph{as well as} negative -- or exhibits dispersive character. These
distinctive features are explained by reciprocity arguments and dressed state
two-photon scattering amplitudes.
