The centrality experiments indicate regime change and saturation in the
behavior of some characteristics of the secondary particles emitted in
hadron-nuclear and nuclear-nuclear interactions at high energies. The
phenomenon has a critical character. The simple models do not explain the
effect. We suppose that the responsible mechanism to explain the phenomenon
could be the formation and decay of the intermediate baryon systems. Such
systems could be formed as a result of nucleon percolation in compressed
baryonic matter. Formation of big percolation cluster may change the properties
of the medium, e.g., it could lead to the changing its transparency. This could
be used to get a signal of the intermediate baryonic system formation. We
consider two signals to identify the formation of the intermediate baryon
systems: the critical changing of transparency of the strongly interacting
matter and the enhancement of light nuclei production with increase in
centrality.
