Let G be any locally compact, unimodular, metrizable group. The main result
of this paper, roughly stated, is that if F<G is any finitely generated free
group and \Gamma < G any lattice, then up to a small perturbation and passing
to a finite index subgroup, F is a subgroup of \Gamma. If G/\Gamma is
noncompact then we require additional hypotheses that include G=SO(n,1).
