When a bilayer of graphene is placed in a suitably configured field effect
device, an asymmetry gap can be generated and the carrier concentration made
different in each layer. This provides a tunable semiconducting gap, and the
valence and the conductance band no longer meet at the two Dirac points of the
graphene Brillouin zone. We calculate the optical conductivity of such a
semiconductor with particular emphasis on the optical spectral weight
redistribution brought about by changes in gap and chemical potential due to
charging. We derive an algebraic formula for arbitrary value of the chemical
potential for the case of the bilayer conductivity without a gap.
