Physical explanation of hyperconductivity and thermal superconductivity
existence is done in given article on the basis of inherent atomic nuclei
oscillations in atoms of materials which are connected with electrons and
phonons and in accordance with the well known Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer
superconductivity theory.
  It is shown that hyperconductivity is the self-supporting, independent
physical phenomenon which is caused by oscillations of atomic nuclei in atoms
of materials and the minimal temperature of its existence does not reach
absolute zero temperature. Hyperconductivity represents the typical dynamic
condition of a material with zero electrical and zero thermal resistances.
