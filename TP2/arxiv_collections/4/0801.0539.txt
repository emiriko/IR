We investigate the dephasing effect of the Kondo singlet in an Aharonov-Bohm
interferometer with a quantum dot coupling to left and right electrodes. By
employing the cluster expansions, the equations of motion of Green functions
are transformed into the corresponding equation of motion of connected Green
functions, which contains the correlation of two conduction electrons beyond
the Lacroix approximation. With the method we show that the Kondo resonance is
suppressed by phase-sensitive detection of Aharonov-Bohm interferometer. Our
numerical results have provided a qualitative explanation with the anomalous
features observed in a recent experiment by Avinun-Kalish \emph{et al}. [Phys.
