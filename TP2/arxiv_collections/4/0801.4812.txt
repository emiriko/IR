A mutator is an allele that increases the mutation rate throughout the genome
by disrupting some aspect of DNA replication or repair. Mutators that increase
the mutation rate by the order of 100 fold have been observed to spontaneously
emerge and achieve high frequencies in natural populations and in long-term
laboratory evolution experiments with \textit{E. coli}. In principle, the
fixation of mutator alleles is limited by (i) competition with mutations in
wild-type backgrounds, (ii) additional deleterious mutational load, and (iii)
random genetic drift. Using a multiple locus model and employing both
simulation and analytic methods, we investigate the effects of these three
factors on the fixation probability $P_{fix}$ of an initially rare mutator as a
function of population size $N$, beneficial and deleterious mutation rates, and
the strength of mutations $s$. Our diffusion based approximation for $P_{fix}$
successfully captures effects (ii) and (iii) when selection is fast compared to
mutation ($\mu/s \ll 1$). This enables us to predict the conditions under which
mutators will be evolutionarily favored. Surprisingly, our simulations show
that effect (i) is typically small for strong-effect mutators. Our results
agree semi-quantitatively with existing laboratory evolution experiments and
suggest future experimental directions.
