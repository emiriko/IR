A cosmological time variable is emerged from the Hamiltonian formulation of
Friedmann model to measure the evolution of dynamical observables in the
theory. A set of observables has been identified for the theory on the null
hypersurfaces that its evolution is with respect to the volume clock introduced
by the cosmological time variable.
