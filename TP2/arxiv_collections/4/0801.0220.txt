Yields for J/psi production in Cu+Cu collisions at sqrt (s_NN)= 200 GeV have
been measured by the PHENIX experiment over the rapidity range |y| < 2.2 at
transverse momenta from 0 to beyond 5 GeV/c. The invariant yield is obtained as
a function of rapidity, transverse momentum and collision centrality, and
compared with results in p+p and Au+Au collisions at the same energy. The Cu+Cu
data provide greatly improved precision over existing Au+Au data for J/psi
production in collisions with small to intermediate numbers of participants,
providing a key constraint that is needed for disentangling cold and hot
nuclear matter effects.
