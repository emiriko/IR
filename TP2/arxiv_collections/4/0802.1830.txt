The lightest QCD resonance, the sigma, has been recently fixed in the pi-pi
scattering amplitude.
  The nature of this state remains nowadays one of the most intriguing and
difficult issues in particle physics. Its coupling to photons is crucial to
discriminate its structure. We propose a new method that fixes this coupling
using only available precise experimental data on the proton electromagnetic
polarizabilities together with analyticity and unitarity. Taking into account
the uncertainties in the analysis and in the parameter values, our result is
Gamma_{pole}(sigma -> gamma gamma) = (1.2 +- 0.4) KeV.
