Geant4 is a Monte Carlo simulation framework for the description of
interactions of particles and matter. Starting with version 8.2 a new package
of QED physics processes is available, allowing for the studies of interactions
of polarised particles with polarised media dedicated to beam applications. In
this contribution some details about the implementation are presented and
applications to the linear collider are discussed.
