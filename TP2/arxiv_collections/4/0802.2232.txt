The spin structure functions g_1 for the proton and the deuteron have been
measured over a wide kinematic range in x and Q2 using 1.6 and 5.7 GeV
longitudinally polarized electrons incident upon polarized NH_3 and ND_3
targets at Jefferson Lab. Scattered electrons were detected in the CEBAF Large
Acceptance Spectrometer, for 0.05 < Q^2 < 5 GeV^2 and W < 3 GeV. The first
moments of g_1 for the proton and deuteron are presented -- both have a
negative slope at low Q^2, as predicted by the extended Gerasimov-Drell-Hearn
sum rule. The first result for the generalized forward spin polarizability of
the proton gamma_0^p is also reported. This quantity shows strong Q^2
dependence at low Q^2, while Q^6\gamma_0^p seems to flatten out at the highest
Q^2 accessed by our experiment. Although the first moments of g_1 are
consistent with Chiral Perturbation Theory (ChPT) calculations up to
approximately Q^2 = 0.06 GeV^2, a significant discrepancy is observed between
the \gamma_0^p data and ChPT for gamma_0^p, even at the lowest Q2.
