Measurements of elementary pp collisions are an integral component to
understand heavy ion collisions. Results for pp collisions at 200 and 62.4 GeV
are presented. At both energies NLO pQCD describes pion production well. The
measured pion transverse single spin asymmetries are very large at 62.4 GeV and
are reasonably well described by models relying on pQCD at transverse momenta
larger than 1 GeV/c.
