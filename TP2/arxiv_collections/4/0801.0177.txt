We develop a three-party quantum secret sharing protocol based on arbitrary
dimensional quantum states. In contrast to the previous quantum secret sharing
protocols, the sender can always control the state, just using local
operations, for adjusting the correlation of measurement directions of three
parties and thus there is no waste of resource due to the discord between the
directions. Moreover, our protocol contains the hidden value which enables the
sender to leak no information of secret key to the dishonest receiver until the
last steps of the procedure.
