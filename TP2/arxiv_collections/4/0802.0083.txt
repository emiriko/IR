New data are presented, concerning narrow exotic structures in mesons,
baryons and dibaryons. The sequence of narrow baryons is quite well described
starting from the sequence of narrow mesons. In the same way, the sequence of
narrow dibaryons is rather well described starting from the sequence of narrow
baryons. Lastly it is shown that the masses of these narrow hadronic structures
lie on straight line Regge-like trajectories.
