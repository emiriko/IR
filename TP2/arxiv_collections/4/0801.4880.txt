The understanding of inactivation radiobiological mechanism in individual
cells is important when from one side the application of ionizing radiation to
tumour therapy and from the other side the protection against radiation are to
be effectively improved. Important part of this mechanism is double-strand
break (DSB) formation; these DSB may be formed directly by impacting ionizing
particles or indirectly by different secondary radicals. The latter kind of
formation is much more frequent when cells contain normal water content.
Mathematical model of the corresponding chemical stage will be presented with
the aim to demonstrate how the individual radicals, but also other chemical
agents present in the water during irradiation may influence DSB formation.
