A short overview about the potential of polarized beams at future colliders
is given. In particular the baseline design for polarized beams at the ILC is
presented and the physics case for polarized $e^-$ and $e^+$ is discussed. In
order to fulfil the precision requirements spin tracking from the source to the
interaction point is needed. Updates concerning the theoretical calculations as
well as their implementation in simulation codes are reported.
