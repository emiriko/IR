The approach to problem of nuclear shadowing based on Gribov Reggeon calculus
is presented. Here the total cross section of $h A$ interaction is found in a
parameter-free description, employing the new data on the gluon density of the
Pomeron, measured with high precision at HERA, as input. The model is then
applied for calculation of $J/\psi$ production in $d Au$ collisions at top RHIC
energy. It is shown that the theoretical estimates are in a very good agreement
with the PHENIX data, and further predictions for the $J/\psi$ suppression in
$p Pb$ collisions at coming soon LHC are made.
