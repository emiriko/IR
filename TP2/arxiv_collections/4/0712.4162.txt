I summarize the history of theoretical predictions of, and experimental
attempts to measure, pion-pion (S-wave) scattering lengths. Recent measurements
at CERN confirm Weinberg's 1966 prediction of the I=2 scattering length and
Basdevant and Lee's subsequent correction of the Weinberg I=0 value by
inclusion of an S-wave I=0 resonance.
