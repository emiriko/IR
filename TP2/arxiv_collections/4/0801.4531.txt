The Wyman's solution depends on two parameters, the mass $M$ and the scalar
charge $\sigma$. If one fixes $M$ to a positive value, say $M_0$, and let
$\sigma^2$ take values along the real line it describes three different types
of spacetimes. For $\sigma^2 >0$ the spacetimes are naked singularities, for
$\sigma^2 = 0$ one has the Schwarzschild black hole of mass $M_0$ and finally
for $-M_0^2 \leq \sigma^2 < 0$ one has wormhole spacetimes. In the present
work, we shall study qualitative and quantitative features of orbits of massive
particles and photons moving in the naked singularity and wormhole spacetimes
of the Wyman solution. These orbits are the timelike geodesics for massive
particles and null geodesics for photons. Combining the four geodesic equations
with an additional equation derived from the line element, we obtain an
effective potential for the massive particles and a different effective
potential for the photons. We investigate all possible types of orbits, for
massive particles and photons, by studying the appropriate effective potential.
We notice that for certain values of $\sigma^2 >0$, there is an infinity
potential wall that prevents both massive particles and photons ever to reach
the naked singularity. We notice, also, that for certain values of $-M_0^2 \leq
\sigma^2 < 0$, the potential is finite everywhere, which allows massive
particles and photons moving from one wormhole asymptotically flat region to
the other. We also compute the radial timelike and null geodesics for massive
particles and photons, respectively, moving in the naked singularities and
wormholes spacetimes.
