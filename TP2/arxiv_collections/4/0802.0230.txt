An experimental study on the nature of spin-dependent excess charge carrier
transitions at the interface between (111) oriented phosphorous doped ([P] ~
10^15 cm^3) crystalline silicon and silicon dioxide at high magnetic field (B_0
~ 8.5 T) is presented. Electrically detected magnetic resonance (EDMR) spectra
of the hyperfine split 31P donor electron transitions and paramagnetic
interface defects were conducted at temperatures in the range 3 K < T < 12 K.
The results at these previously unattained (for EDMR) magnetic field strengths
reveal the dominance of spin-dependent processes that differ from the
previously well investigated recombination between the 31P donor and the P_b
state, which dominates at low magnetic fields. While magnetic resonant current
responses due to 31P and P_b states are still present, they do not correlate
and only the P_b contribution can be associated with an interface process due
to spin-dependent tunneling between energetically and physically adjacent P_b
states. This work provides an experimental demonstration of spin-dependent
tunneling between physically adjacent and identical electronic states as
proposed by Kane for readout of donor qubits.
