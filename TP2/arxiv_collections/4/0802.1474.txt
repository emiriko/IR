Model independent formulae are derived for the beam analyzing power $A_y$ and
beam to meson spin transfers in $pp \to pp \omega$ taking into consideration
all the six threshold partial wave amplitudes covering the $Ss, Sp$ and $Ps$
channels. Attention is also focussed on the empirical determination of the
lowest three partial wave amplitudes $f_1, f_2, f_3$ without any discrete
ambiguities.
