We study a non-commutative deformation of general relativity based on
spectral invariants of a partial differential operator acting on sections of a
vector bundle over a smooth manifold. We compute the first non-commutative
corrections to Einstein equations in the weak deformation limit and analyze the
spectrum of the theory. Related topics are discussed as well.
