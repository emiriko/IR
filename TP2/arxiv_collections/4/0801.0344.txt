We revisit the Littlest Higgs model with $T$-parity, and discover a $Z_2$
symmetry on collective symmetry. It is dubbed collective parity
($\EuScript{C}$-parity). We demonstrate that $T$-parity is consistent with
$\EuScript{C}$-parity. We further investigate the origin of the collective
symmetry in the context of composite Higgs and find a new path to the UV
complete theory of the model. In addition, we demonstrate that $T$-parity
violating processes naturally take place.
