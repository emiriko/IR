Spin splitting in p-type semiconductor nanowires is strongly affected by the
interplay between quantum confinement and spin-orbit coupling in the valence
band. The latter's particular importance is revealed in our systematic
theoretical study presented here, which has mapped the range of spin-orbit
coupling strengths realized in typical semiconductors. Large controllable
variations of the g-factor with associated characteristic spin polarization are
shown to exist for nanowire subband edges, which therefore turn out to be a
versatile laboratory for investigating the complex spin properties exhibited by
quantum-confined holes.
