We consider the hydrodynamic effect of small particles on the dynamics of a
much larger particle moving normal to a planar wall in a highly bidisperse
dilute colloidal suspension of spheres. The gap $h_0$ between the large
particle and the wall is assumed to be comparable to the diameter $2a$ of the
smaller particles so there is a length-scale separation between the gap width
$h_0$ and the radius of the large particle $b<<h_0$. We use this length-scale
separation to develop a new lubrication theory which takes into account the
presence of the smaller particles in the space between the larger particle and
the wall. The hydrodynamic effect of the small particles on the motion of the
large particle is characterized by the short time (or high frequency)
resistance coefficient. We find that for small particle-wall separations $h_0$,
the resistance coefficient tends to the asymptotic value corresponding to the
large particle moving in a clear suspending fluid. For $h_0<<a$, the resistance
coefficient approaches the lubrication value corresponding to a particle moving
in a fluid with the effective viscosity given by the Einstein formula.
