The occurrence of a pygmy dipole resonance in proton rich Ar-32 and Ar-34 is
studied using the unitary correlator operator method interaction Vucom, based
on Argonne V18. Predictions from the random phase approximation (RPA) and the
shell model in a no-core basis are compared.
  It is found that the inclusion of configuration mixing up to
two-particle--two-holes broadens the pygmy strength slightly and reduces
sensibly its strength, as compared to the RPA predictions. For Ar-32 a clear
peak associated with a pygmy resonance is found. For Ar-34, the pygmy states
are obtained close to the giant dipole resonance and mix with it.
