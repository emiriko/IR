The problem of constructing the kinetic equation with the description of
motion of a hole in systems with strong spin- hole interaction (such as high-
temperature superconductors) in terms of the spin polaron has been considered
in the framework of the regular antiferromagnetic $s-d$ model. It has been
shown by the example of the electrical resistivity that kinetics is determined
by the properties of the bands of the spin polaron (rather than "bar hole") and
their quasiparticle residues $Z_{k}$. The cases of low and optimal doping of
the $CuO_{2}$ plane have been considered. It has been shown that the
rearrangement of the spectrum of the lower polaron band, as well as the strong
doping dependence of the quasiparticle residues $Z_{k}$ is decisive in the
unified consideration of these cases.
