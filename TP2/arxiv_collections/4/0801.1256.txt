The dynamical generation of Dirac mass in the supersymmetric
Nambu$-$Jona-Lasinio (SNJL) model with the seesaw mechanism of neutrino is
investigeted. The right and left handed Majorana mass parameters are introduced
into the SNJL model; we regard them as external model parameters. The question
on the origin of these Majorana masses are set aside, and we concentrate on the
examination of the effect of the Majorana mass parameters on the dynamical
generation of Dirac mass. The effective potential of the model and the gap
equation for the self-consistent determination of Dirac mass are derived and
solved. We use both the four-dimensional covariant and three-dimensional
non-covariant cutoff schemes for the regularizations of the effective
potential. We find there are cases of the first and second order phase
transitions with respect to variation of the coupling constant of the
Nambu$-$Jona-Lasinio-type four-body interaction of the SNJL model. In the case
of second-order phase transition, the dynamically generated Dirac mass
$|\phi_{S}|$ can arbitrarily be small compared with the right-handed Majorana
mass parameter $|M|$ and thus the seesaw condition $0<|\phi_{S}|\ll|M|$ can be
satisfied by a fine tuning of the coupling constant, while at the first-order
case it seems very difficult and/or "unnatural" to satisfy the condition. The
numerical results do not depend on the difference of the cutoff schemes
qualitatively.
