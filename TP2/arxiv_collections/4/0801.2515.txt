We report a new approach for progressive and well-controlled downsizing of
nanostructures below the 10 nm scale. Low energetic ion beam (Ar+) is used for
gentle surface erosion, progressively shrinking the dimensions with ~ 1 nm
accuracy. The method enables shaping of nanostructure geometry and polishing
the surface. The process is clean room / high vacuum compatible being suitable
for various applications. Apart from technological advantages, the method
enables study of various size phenomena on the same sample between sessions of
ion beam treatment.
