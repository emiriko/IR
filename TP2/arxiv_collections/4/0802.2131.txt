We prove uniqueness and existence of the weak solutions of Euler equations
with helical symmetry, with initial vorticity in $L^{\infty}$ under "no
vorticity stretching" geometric constraint. Our article follows the argument of
the seminal work of Yudovich. We adjust the argument to resolve the
difficulties which are specific to the helical symmetry.
