In this letter, we have assumed that the Universe is filled in tachyonic
field with potential, which gives the acceleration of the Universe. For certain
choice of potential, we have found the exact solutions of the field equations.
We have shown the decaying nature of potential. From recently developed
statefinder parameters, we have investigated the role of tachyonic field in
different stages of the evolution of the Universe.
