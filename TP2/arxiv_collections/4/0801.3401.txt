The aim of the paper is to present various asymptotic behaviors of
skew-evolution semiflows in Banach spaces, as exponential decay, instability,
exponential in- stability and integral instability. Relations between these
asymptotic properties are also given. As main results, two Datko type theorems
are proved. A unified nonuniform approach is provided.
