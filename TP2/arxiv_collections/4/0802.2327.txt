The quantum information transfer between a single photon and a two-level atom
is considered as a part of a quantum channel. The channel is a degradable
channel even when there are decays of the atomic excited state and the single
photon state, as far as the total excitation of the combined initial state does
not exceed 1. The single letter formula for quantum capacity is obtained.
