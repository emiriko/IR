Vortices and axisymmetric vortex rings are considered in the framework of the
subcritical nonlinear Schrodinger equations. The higher order nonlinearity
present in such systems models many-body interactions in superfluid systems and
allows one to study the effects of negative pressure on vortex dynamics. We
find the critical pressure for which the straight-line vortex becomes unstable
to radial expansion of the core. The energy of the straight-line vortices and
energy, impulse and velocity of vortex rings are calculated. The effect of a
varying pressure on the vortex core is studied. It is shown that under the
action of the periodically varying pressure field a vortex ring may split into
many vortex rings and the conditions for which this happens are elucidated.
These processes are also relevant to experiments in Bose-Einstein condensates
where the strength and the sign of two-body interactions can be changed via
Feshbach resonance.
