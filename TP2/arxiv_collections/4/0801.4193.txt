We consider a system of repulsively interacting Bose-Fermi mixtures of spin
polarized uniform atomic gases at zero temperature. We examine possible
realization of p-wave superfluidity of fermions due to an effective attractive
interaction via density fluctuations of Bose-Einstein condensate within
mean-field approximation. We find the ground state of the system by direct
energy comparison of p-wave superfluid and phase-separated states, and suggest
an occurrence of the p-wave superfluid for a strong boson-fermion interaction
regime. We study some signatures in the p-wave superfluid phase, such as
anisotropic energy gap and quasi-particle energy in the axial state, that have
not been observed in spin unpolarized superfluid of atomic fermions. We also
show that a Cooper pair is a tightly bound state like a diatomic molecule in
the strong boson-fermion coupling regime and suggest an observable indication
of the p-wave superfluid in the real experiment.
