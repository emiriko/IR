Glass-forming liquids display strong fluctuations -- dynamical
heterogeneities -- near their glass transition. By numerically simulating a
binary Weeks-Chandler-Andersen liquid and varying both temperature and
timescale, we investigate the probability distributions of two kinds of local
fluctuations in the non-equilibrium (aging) regime and in the equilibrium
regime; and find them to be very similar in the two regimes and across
temperatures. We also observe that, when appropriately rescaled, the integrated
dynamic susceptibility is very weakly dependent on temperature and very similar
in both regimes.
