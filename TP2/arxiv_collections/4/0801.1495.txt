We present a meshfree numerical solver for scalar conservation laws in one
space dimension. Points representing the solution are moved according to their
characteristic velocities. Particle interaction is resolved by purely local
particle management. Since no global remeshing is required, shocks stay sharp
and propagate at the correct speed, while rarefaction waves are created where
appropriate. The method is TVD, entropy decreasing, exactly conservative, and
has no numerical dissipation. Difficulties involving transonic points do not
occur, however inflection points of the flux function pose a slight challenge,
which can be overcome by a special treatment. Away from shocks the method is
second order accurate, while shocks are resolved with first order accuracy. A
postprocessing step can recover the second order accuracy. The method is
compared to CLAWPACK in test cases and is found to yield an increase in
accuracy for comparable resolutions.
