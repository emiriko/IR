Violation of modified Wigner inequality by means binary bipartite quantum
system allows the discrimination between the quantum world and the classical
local-realistic one, and also ensures the security of Ekert-like quantum key
distribution protocol. In this paper we study both theoretically and
experimentally the bounds of quantum correlation associated to the modified
Wigner's inequality finding the optimal experimental configuration for its
maximal violation. We also extend this analysis to the implementation of
Ekert's protocol.
