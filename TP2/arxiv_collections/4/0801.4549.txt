We point out that, if one accepts the validity of quantum mechanics, the Bell
parameter for the polarization state of two photons can be measured in a
simpler way than by the standard procedure [Clauser, Horne, Shimony, and Holt,
Phys. Rev. Lett. 23, 880 (1969)]. The proposed method requires only two
measurements with parallel linear-polarizer settings for Alice and Bob at 0 and
45 degrees, and yields a significantly smaller statistical error for a large
Bell parameter.
