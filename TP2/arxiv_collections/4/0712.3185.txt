In the limit of very fast rotation atomic Bose-Einstein condensates may
reside entirely in the lowest two-dimensional Landau level (LLL). For small
enough filling factor of the LLL, one may have formation of fractional quantum
Hall states. We investigate the case of bosons with dipolar interactions as may
be realized with Chromium-52 atoms. We show that at filling factor equal to
unity the ground state is a Moore-Read (a.k.a Pfaffian) paired state as is the
case of bosons with purely s-wave scattering interactions. This Pfaffian state
is destabilized when the interaction in the s-wave channel is small enough and
the ground state is a stripe phase with unidimensional density modulation. For
filling factor 1/3, we show that there is formation of a Fermi sea of
``composite fermions''. These composites are made of one boson bound with three
vortices. This phase has a wide range of stability and the effective mass of
the fermions depends essentially only of the scattering amplitude in momentum
channels larger or equal to 2. The formation of such a Fermi sea opens up a new
possible route to detection of the quantum Hall correlations.
