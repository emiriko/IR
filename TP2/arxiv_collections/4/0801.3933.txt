The voltage-controlled Berry phases in two vertically coupled InGaAs/GaAs
quantum dots are investigated theoretically. It is found that Berry phases can
be changed dramatically from 0 to 2$\pi$ (or 2$\pi$ to 0) only simply by
turning the external voltage. Under realistic conditions, as the tunneling is
varied from $0.8eV$ to $0.9eV$ via a bias voltage, the Berry phases are altered
obviously, which can be detected in an interference experiment. The scheme is
expected to be useful in constructing quantum computation based on geometric
phases in an asymmetrical double quantum dot controlled by voltage.
