The Supersymmetry Les Houches Accord (SLHA) provides a universal set of
conventions for conveying spectral and decay information for supersymmetry
analysis problems in high energy physics. Here, we propose extensions of the
conventions of the first SLHA to include various generalisations: the minimal
supersymmetric standard model with violation of CP, R-parity, and flavour, as
well as the simplest next-to-minimal model.
