We report the achievement of an optically guided and quasi-monomode atom
laser, in all spin projection states ($m_F =$ -1, 0 and $+1$) of F=1 in
Rubidium 87. The atom laser source is a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) in a
crossed dipole trap, purified to any one spin projection state by a
spin-distillation process applied during the evaporation to BEC. The atom laser
is outcoupled by an inhomogenous magnetic field, applied along the waveguide
axis. The mean excitation number in the transverse modes is $<n > = 0.65 \pm
0.05$ for $m_F = 0 $ and $<n > = 0.8 \pm 0.3$ for the low field seeker $m_F =
-1$.
