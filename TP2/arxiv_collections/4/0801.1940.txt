Corresponding to optical Fresnel transformation characteristic of ray
transfer matrix elements (A;B;C;D); AD-BC = 1, there exists Fresnel operator
F(A;B;C;D) in quantum optics, we show that under the Fresnel transformation the
pure position density |x><x| becomes the tomographic density |x>_rs,rs_<x|,
which is just the Radon transform of the Wigner operator, i.e.,
  F|x><x|F^(+) = |x>_rs,rs_<x|= \int dx'dp'delta[x-(Dx'-Bp')]*Wigner operator
where s, r are the complex-value expression of (A;B;C;D). So the probability
distribution for the Fresnel quadrature phase is the tomography (Radon
transform of Wigner function), and the tomogram of a state |phi> is just the
wave function of its Fresnel transformed state F|phi>, i.e. rs_<x||phi>=
<x|F^(+)|phi>. Similarly, we find F|p><p|F^(+) = |p>_rs,rs_<p|= \int
dx'dp'delta[x-(Ap'-Cx')]*Wigner operator.
