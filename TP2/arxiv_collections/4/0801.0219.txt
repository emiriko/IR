The well-known characterizations of Schwartz space $\mathcal{S}$ of rapidly
decreasing functions is extended to the algebra $\mathcal{G}_{\mathcal{S}}$ of
rapidly decreasing generalized functions and to the algebra $\mathcal{G}_{%
\mathcal{S}}^{\infty}$ of regular rapidly decreasing generalized functions.
