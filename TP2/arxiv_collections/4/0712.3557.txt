This paper proposes an axiomatic for Cyclic Foam Topological Field theories.
That is Topological Field theories, corresponding to String theories, where
particles are arbitrary graphs. World surfaces in this case are two-manifolds
with one-dimensional singularities. We proved that Cyclic Foam Topological
Field theories one-to-one correspond to graph-Cardy-Frobenius algebras, that
are families $(A,B_\star,\phi)$, where $A=\{A^s|s\in S\}$ are families of
commutative associative Frobenius algebras, $B_\star =
\bigoplus_{\sigma\in\Sigma} B_\sigma$ is an graduated by graphes, associative
algebras of Frobenius type and $\phi=\{\phi_\sigma^s: A^s\to (B_\sigma)|s\in
S,\sigma\in \Sigma\}$ is a family of special representations. There are
constructed examples of Cyclic Foam Topological Field theories and its
graph-Cardy-Frobenius algebras
