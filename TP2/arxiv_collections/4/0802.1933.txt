In this work we report Monte Carlo simulations of a 2D Ising model, in which
the statistics of the Metropolis algorithm is replaced by the nonextensive one.
We compute the magnetization and show that phase transitions are present for
$q\neq 1$. A $q -$ phase diagram (critical temperature vs. the entropic
parameter $q$) is built and exhibits some interesting features, such as phases
which are governed by the value of the entropic index $q$. It is shown that
such phases favors some energy levels of magnetization states. It is also
showed that the contribution of the Tsallis cutoff is essential to the
existence of phase transitions.
