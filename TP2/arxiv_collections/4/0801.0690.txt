Quantum protocols for bit commitment have been proposed and it is largely
accepted that unconditionally secure quantum bit commitment is not possible;
however, it can be more secure than classical bit commitment. In despite of its
usefulness, quantum bit commitment protocols have not been experimentally
implemented. The main reason is the fact that all proposed quantum bit
commitment protocols require quantum memory. In this work, we show a quantum
bit commitment protocol that does not require quantum memory and can be
implemented with present technology.
