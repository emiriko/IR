We prove a resolvent estimate for the Laplace-Beltrami operator on a
scattering manifold with a hyperbolic trapped set, and as a corollary deduce
local smoothing. We use a result of Nonnenmacher-Zworski to provide an estimate
near the trapped region, a result of Burq and Cardoso-Vodev to provide an
estimate near infinity, and the microlocal calculus on scattering manifolds to
combine the two.
