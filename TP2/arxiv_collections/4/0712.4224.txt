The coevolutionary dynamics in finite populations currently is investigated
in a wide range of disciplines, as chemical catalysis, biological evolution,
social and economic systems. The dynamics of those systems can be formulated
within the unifying framework of evolutionary game theory. However it is not a
priori clear which mathematical description is appropriate when populations are
not infinitely large. Whereas the replicator equation approach describes the
infinite population size limit by deterministic differential equations, in
finite populations the dynamics is inherently stochastic which can lead to new
effects. Recently, an explicit mean-field description in the form of a
Fokker-Planck equation was derived for frequency-dependent selection in finite
populations based on microscopic processes. In asymmetric conflicts between two
populations with a cyclic dominance, a finite-size dependent drift reversal was
demonstrated, depending on the underlying microscopic process of the
evolutionary update. Cyclic dynamics appears widely in biological coevolution,
be it within a homogeneous population, or be it between disjunct populations as
female and male. Here explicit analytic address is given and the average drift
is calculated for the frequency-dependent Moran process and for different
pairwise comparison processes. It is explicitely shown that the drift reversal
cannot occur if the process relies on payoff differences between pairs of
individuals. Further, also a linear comparison with the average payoff does not
lead to a drift towards the internal fixed point. Hence the nonlinear
comparison function of the frequency-dependent Moran process, together with its
usage of nonlocal information via the average payoff, is the essential part of
the mechanism.
