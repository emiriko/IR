We measure the mean lifetime, tau=2/(Gamma_L+Gamma_H), and the width
difference, DeltaGamma=Gamma_L-Gamma_H, of the light and heavy mass eigenstates
of the B0s meson, B0sL and B0sH, in B0s -> J/psi phi decays using 1.7 fb^-1 of
data collected with the CDF II detector at the Fermilab Tevatron ppbar
collider. Assuming CP conservation, a good approximation for the B0s system in
the Standard Model, we obtain DeltaGamma = 0.076^+0.059_-0.063 (stat.) +- 0.006
(syst.) ps^-1 and tau = 1.52 +- 0.04 (stat.) +- 0.02 (syst.) ps, the most
precise measurements to date. Our constraints on the weak phase and DeltaGamma
are consistent with CP conservation.
