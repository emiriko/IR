These lectures review some of the recent progress in uncovering the phase
structure of black hole solutions in higher-dimensional vacuum Einstein
gravity. The two classes on which we focus are Kaluza-Klein black holes, i.e.
static solutions with an event horizon in asymptotically flat spaces with
compact directions, and stationary solutions with an event horizon in
asymptotically flat space. Highlights include the recently constructed
multi-black hole configurations on the cylinder and thin rotating black rings
in dimensions higher than five. The phase diagram that is emerging for each of
the two classes will be discussed, including an intriguing connection that
relates the phase structure of Kaluza-Klein black holes with that of
asymptotically flat rotating black holes.
