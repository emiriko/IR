This paper introduces QuanFou v1.1, QuanGlue v1.1, QuanOracle v1.1, QuanShi
v1.1, four Java applications available for free. (Source code included in the
distribution.) Each application compiles a different kind of input quantum
evolution operator. The applications output a quantum circuit that equals the
input evolution operator.
