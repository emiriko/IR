Single-electron ionization and excitation cross sections as well as cross
sections for excitation into the first excited p state of the alkali metal
atoms Li(2s), Na(3s) and K(4s) colliding with antiprotons and protons were
calculated using a time-dependent channel-coupling approach. For antiprotons an
impact-energy range from 0.25 to 1000 keV and for protons from 2 to 1000 keV
was considered. The target atoms are treated as effective one-electron systems
using a model potential. The results are compared with theoretical and
experimental data from literature and calculated cross sections for
antiproton-hydrogen collisions. For proton collisions a good overall agreement
is found which confirms the present numerical approach, whereas discrepancies
are found between the present antiproton cross sections and those calculated by
Stary et al., J.Phys.B 23, 263 (1990).
