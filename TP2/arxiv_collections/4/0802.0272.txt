An efficient O(N) cluster Monte Carlo method for Ising models with long-range
interactions is presented. Our novel algorithm does not introduce any cutoff
for interaction range and thus it strictly fulfills the detailed balance. The
realized stochastic dynamics is equivalent to that of the conventional
Swendsen-Wang algorithm, which requires O(N^2) operations per Monte Carlo sweep
if applied to long-range interacting models. In addition, it is shown that the
total energy and the specific heat can also be measured in O(N) time. We
demonstrate the efficiency of our algorithm over the conventional method and
the O(N log N) algorithm by Luijten and Bloete. We also apply our algorithm to
the classical and quantum Ising chains with inverse-square ferromagnetic
interactions, and confirm in a high accuracy that a Kosterlitz-Thouless phase
transition, associated with a universal jump in the magnetization, occurs in
both cases.
