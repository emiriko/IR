We prove a Freidlin-Wentzell large deviation principle for general stochastic
evolution equations with small perturbation multiplicative noises. In
particular, our general result can be used to deal with a large class of quasi
linear stochastic partial differential equations, such as stochastic porous
medium equations and stochastic reaction diffusion equations with polynomial
growth zero order term and $p$-Laplacian second order term.
