We establish global well-posedness and scattering for solutions to the
mass-critical nonlinear Hartree equation $iu_t+\Delta u=\pm(|x|^{-2}*|u|^2)u$
for large spherically symmetric $L^2_x(\Bbb{R}^d)$ initial data; in the
focusing case we require, of course, that the mass is strictly less than that
of the ground state.
