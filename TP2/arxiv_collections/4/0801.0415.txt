We compare results of $k_t$-factorization approach and next-to-leading order
collinear-factorization approach for photon-jet correlations in $pp$ and $p
\bar p$ collisions at RHIC, Tevatron and LHC energies. We discuss correlations
in azimuthal angle between photon and jet as well as correlations in
two-dimensional space of photon and jet transverse momenta. Different
unintegrated gluon/parton distributions are used in the $k_t$-factorization
approach. The results depend on UGDF/UPDF used. The collinear NLO $2 \to 3$
contributions dominate over $k_t$-factorization cross section at small relative
azimuthal angles as well as for asymmetric transverse momentum configurations.
