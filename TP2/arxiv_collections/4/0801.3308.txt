In this paper we have used our recently developed ab initio
Wannier-function-based methodology to perform extensive Hartree-Fock and
correlated calculations on Li$_{2}$O and LiCl to compute their Born effective
charges. Results thus obtained are in very good agreement with the experiments.
In particular, for the case of Li$_{2}$O, we resolve a controversy originating
in the experiment of Osaka and Shindo {[}Solid State Commun. 51 (1984) 421] who
had predicted the effective charge of Li ions to be in the range 0.58--0.61, a
value much smaller compared to its nominal value of unity, thereby, suggesting
that the bonding in the material could be partially covalent. We demonstrate
that effective charge computed by Osaka and Shindo is the Szigeti charge, and
once the Born charge is computed, it is in excellent agreement with our
computed value. Mulliken population analysis of Li$_{2}$O also confirms ionic
nature of the bonding in the substance.
