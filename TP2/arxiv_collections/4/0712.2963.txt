The exponential speed up of quantum algorithms and the fundamental limits of
current CMOS process for future design technology have directed attentions
toward quantum circuits. In this paper, the matrix specification of a broad
category of quantum circuits, i.e. CNOT-based circuits, are investigated. We
prove that the matrix elements of CNOT-based circuits can only be zeros or
ones. In addition, the columns or rows of such a matrix have exactly one
element with the value of 1. Furthermore, we show that these specifications can
be used to synthesize CNOT-based quantum circuits. In other words, a new scheme
is introduced to convert the matrix representation into its SOP equivalent
using a novel quantum-based Karnaugh map extension. We then apply a
search-based method to transform the obtained SOP into a CNOT-based circuit.
Experimental results prove the correctness of the proposed concept.
