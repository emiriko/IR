Since the top quark FCNC processes are extremely supressed in the Standard
Model (SM) but could be greatly enhanced in some new physics models, they could
serve as a smoking gun for new physics hunting at the LHC. In this brief review
we summarize the new physics predictions for various top quark FCNC processes
at the LHC by focusing on two typical models: the minimal supersymmetric model
(MSSM) and the topcolor-assisted technicolor (TC2) model. The conclusion is:
(1) Both new physics models can greatly enhance the SM predictions by several
orders; (2) The TC2 model allows for largest enhancement, and for each channel
the maximal prediction is much larger than in the MSSM; (3) Compared with the
$3\sigma$ sensitivity at the LHC, only a couple of channels are accessible for
the MSSM while most channles are accesible for the TC2 model.
