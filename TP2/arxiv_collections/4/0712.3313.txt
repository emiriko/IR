We study the effect of the Singwi-Tosi-Land-Sj\"{o}lander local field
correction on spin relaxation/dephasing in $n$-type GaAs quantum wells at low
temperature by constructing and numerically solving the kinetic spin Bloch
equations. We calculate the local field factor $G(q)$ in quantum wells by
numerically solving three equations which link the local field factor, the
structure factor, and the dielectric function, self-consistently. Such a
correction reduces both the electron-electron Coulomb scattering and the
Coulomb Hartree-Fock term. We compare the spin relaxation times with and
without this correction under different conditions such as temperature,
electron density, well width and spin polarization. We find that this
correction leads to a decrease/increase of the spin relaxation time in the
strong/weak scattering limit. At high spin polarization, it reduces the
Hartree-Fock term and consequently tends to decrease the spin relaxation time.
The modification of the spin relaxation time by the local field correction is
more or less moderate either due to the coexistence of scattering other than
the Coulomb scattering at low spin polarization and/or due to the competing
effects from the Coulomb scattering and the Coulomb Hartree-Fock term at high
polarization.
