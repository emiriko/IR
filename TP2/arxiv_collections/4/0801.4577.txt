We report measurements of the x-ray scattering intensity as mesoporous
glasses are filled with Neon. We outline a simple model to account for the
non-linear increase in the intensity of the first peak in a liquid-like
diffraction pattern as a monolayer is formed. This allows us to demonstrate an
approach for surface area determination which does not rely on thermodynamic
models, and is therefore complimentary to existing models.
