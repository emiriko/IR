In this paper, we describe a Graphical User Interface (GUI) designed to
manage large quantities of image data of a biological system. After setting the
design requirements for the system, we developed an ecology quantification GUI
that assists biologists in analysing data. We focus on the main features of the
interface and we present the results and an evaluation of the system. Finally,
we provide some directions for some future work.
