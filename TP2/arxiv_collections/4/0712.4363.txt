We present a definition of the distance between probability distributions.
Our definition is based on the $L_1$ norm on space of probability measures. We
compare our distance with the well-known Kullback-Leibler divergence and with
the proper distance defined using the Fisher matrix as a metric on the
parameter space. We consider using our notion of distance in several problems
in gravitational wave data analysis: to place templates in the parameter space
in searches for gravitational-wave signals, to assess quality of search
templates, and to study the signal resolution.
