We discuss an inverse approach for atomistic modeling of glassy materials.
The focus is on structural modeling and electronic properties of hydrogenated
amorphous silicon and glassy GeSe2 alloy. The work is based upon a new approach
"experimentally constrained molecular relaxation (ECMR)". Unlike conventional
approaches (such as molecular dynamics (MD) and Monte Carlo simulations(MC),
where a potential function is specified and the system evolves either
deterministically (MD) or stochastically (MC), we develop a novel scheme to
model structural configurations using experimental data in association with
density functional calculations. We have applied this approach to model
hydrogenated amorphous silicon and glassy GeSe2. The electronic and structural
properties of these models are compared with experimental data and models
obtained from conventional molecular dynamics simulation.
