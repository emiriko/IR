In this paper we focus on the water waves problem for uneven bottoms on a
two-dimensionnal domain. Starting from the symmetric Boussinesq systems derived
in [Chazel, Influence of topography on long water waves, 2007], we recover the
uncoupled Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) approximation justified by Schneider and
Wayne for flat bottoms, and by Iguchi in the context of bottoms tending to zero
at infinity at a substantial rate. The goal of this paper is to investigate the
validity of this approximation for more general bathymetries. We exhibit two
kinds of topography for which this approximation diverges from the Boussinesq
solutions. A topographically modified KdV approximation is then proposed to
deal with such bathymetries. Finally, all the models involved are numerically
computed and compared.
