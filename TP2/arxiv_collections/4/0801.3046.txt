A mathematical model is developed that captures the transport of liquid water
in hardened concrete, as well as the chemical reactions that occur between the
imbibed water and the residual calcium silicate compounds residing in the
porous concrete matrix. The main hypothesis in this model is that the reaction
product -- calcium silicate hydrate gel -- clogs the pores within the concrete
thereby hindering water transport. Numerical simulations are employed to
determine the sensitivity of the model solution to changes in various physical
parameters, and compare to experimental results available in the literature.
