Biomolecular structures are assemblies of emergent anisotropic building
modules such as uniaxial helices or biaxial strands. We provide an approach to
understanding a marginally compact phase of matter that is occupied by proteins
and DNA. This phase, which is in some respects analogous to the liquid crystal
phase for chain molecules, stabilizes a range of shapes that can be obtained by
sequence-independent interactions occurring intra- and intermolecularly between
polymeric molecules. We present a singularityfree self-interaction for a tube
in the continuum limit and show that this results in the tube being positioned
in the marginally compact phase. Our work provides a unified framework for
understanding the building blocks of biomolecules.
