Three-dimensional (3D) hybrid particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations, with
kinetic ions and fluid electrons, of a plasma cloud expansion in the solar wind
are presented, revealing the dynamics of the expansion, with shock formation,
magnetic field compression, and the solar wind ions deflection around the
plasma bubble. The similarities of this system with a magnetosphere are also
pointed out.
