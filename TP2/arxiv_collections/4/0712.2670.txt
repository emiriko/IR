We show that the colour glass condensate dipole model of Iancu, Itakura and
Munier, improved to include the impact parameter dependence, gives a good fit
to the total gamma* p cross section measured at HERA if the anomalous dimension
at the saturation scale, gamma_s, is treated as a free parameter. We find that
the optimum value of gamma_s = 0.46 is close to the value determined from
numerical solution of the Balitsky-Kovchegov equation. The impact parameter
dependent saturation scale is generally less than 0.5 GeV^2 in the HERA
kinematic regime for the most relevant impact parameters b ~ 2-3 GeV^{-1}. We
compare predictions of the model to data on the longitudinal and heavy flavour
structure functions, exclusive diffractive vector meson production and deeply
virtual Compton scattering at HERA. The model is found to be deficient for
observables sensitive to moderately small dipole sizes, where an alternative
model with explicit DGLAP evolution performs better. The energy dependence of
exclusive diffractive processes is shown to provide an important discriminator
between different dipole model cross sections.
