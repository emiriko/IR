The paper presents an authentication scheme for remote systems using smart
card. The scheme prevents the scenario of many logged in users with the same
login identity, and does not require password/verifier table to validate the
users' login request. The scheme provides a user-friendly password change
option, and withstands the replay, impersonation, stolen-verifier, guessing,
and denial-of-service attacks.
