We determine the equation of state of stoichiometric FeO employing the
diffusion Monte Carlo method. The fermionic nodes are fixed to those of a wave
function having the form of a single Slater determinant. The calculated ambient
pressure properties (lattice constant, bulk modulus and cohesive energy) agree
very well with available experimental data. At approximately 65 GPa, the
lattice structure is found to change from rocksalt type (B1) to NiAs based
(inverse B8).
