We introduce a two dimensional model for the Bose-Einstein condensate with
both attractive and repulsive nonlinearities. We assume a combination of a
double well potential in one direction, and an optical lattice along the
perpendicular coordinate. We look for dual core solitons in this model,
focusing on their symmetry-breaking bifurcations. The analysis employs a
variational approximation, which is verified by numerical results. The
bifurcation which transforms antisymmetric gap solitons into asymmetric ones is
of supercritical type in the case of repulsion; in the attraction model,
increase of the optical latttice strength leads to a gradual transition from
subcritical bifurcation (for symmetric solitons) to a supercritical one.
