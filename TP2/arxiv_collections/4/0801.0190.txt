We have performed $^{69,71}$Ga nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and nuclear
quadrupole resonance (NQR) and muon spin rotation/resonance on the quasi
two-dimensional antiferromagnet (AFM) NiGa$_2$S$_4$, in order to investigate
its spin dynamics and magnetic state at low temperatures. Although there exists
only one crystallographic site for Ga in NiGa$_2$S$_4$, we found two distinct
Ga signals by NMR and NQR. The origin of the two Ga signals is not fully
understood, but possibly due to stacking faults along the c axis which induce
additional broad Ga NMR and NQR signals with different local symmetries. We
found the novel spin freezing occurring at $T_{\rm f}$, at which the specific
heat shows a maximum, from a clear divergent behavior of the nuclear
spin-lattice relaxation rate $1/T_{1}$ and nuclear spin-spin relaxation rate
$1/T_{2}$ measured by Ga-NQR as well as the muon spin relaxation rate
$\lambda$. The main sharp NQR peaks exhibit a stronger tendency of divergence,
compared with the weak broader spectral peaks, indicating that the spin
freezing is intrinsic in NiGa$_2$S$_4$. The behavior of these relaxation rates
strongly suggests that the Ni spin fluctuations slow down towards $T_{\rm f}$,
and the temperature range of the divergence is anomalously wider than that in a
conventional magnetic ordering. A broad structureless spectrum and
multi-component $T_1$ were observed below 2 K, indicating that a static
magnetic state with incommensurate magnetic correlations or inhomogeneously
distributed moments is realized at low temperatures. However, the wide
temperature region between 2 K and $T_{\rm f}$, where the NQR signal was not
observed, suggests that the Ni spins do not freeze immediately below $T_{\rm
f}$, but keep fluctuating down to 2 K with the MHz frequency range.
