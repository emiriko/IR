In this paper we study the interaction of a Dirac-Pauli particle with an
electromagnetic plane wave, by using a previously given generalization of the
pseudo-classical Lagrangian for a spinning particle with an anomalous magnetic
moment. We derive the explicit expressions for the eigenfunctions and the
Green's functions of the theory. We discuss the validity of the semi-classical
approach by comparing the wavefunctions with the (pseudo)-classical solutions
of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation.
