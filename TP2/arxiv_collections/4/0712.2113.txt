In its recently published TCG Mobile Reference Architecture, the TCG Mobile
Phone Work Group specifies a new concept to enable trust into future mobile
devices. For this purpose, the TCG devises a trusted mobile platform as a set
of trusted engines on behalf of different stakeholders supported by a physical
trust-anchor. In this paper, we present our perception on this emerging
specification. We propose an approach for the practical design and
implementation of this concept and how to deploy it to a trustworthy operating
platform. In particular we propose a method for the take-ownership of a device
by the user and the migration (i.e., portability) of user credentials between
devices.
