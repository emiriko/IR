Energy consumption is the most important factor that determines sensor node
lifetime. The optimization of wireless sensor network lifetime targets not only
the reduction of energy consumption of a single sensor node but also the
extension of the entire network lifetime. We propose a simple and adaptive
energy-conserving topology management scheme, called SAND (Self-Organizing
Active Node Density). SAND is fully decentralized and relies on a distributed
probing approach and on the redundancy resolution of sensors for energy
optimizations, while preserving the data forwarding and sensing capabilities of
the network. We present the SAND's algorithm, its analysis of convergence, and
simulation results. Simulation results show that, though slightly increasing
path lengths from sensor to sink nodes, the proposed scheme improves
significantly the network lifetime for different neighborhood densities
degrees, while preserving both sensing and routing fidelity.
