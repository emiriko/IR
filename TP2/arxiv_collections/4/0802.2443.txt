The logical foundations of Bell's inequality are reexamined. We argue that
the form of the reality condition that underpins Bell's inequality comes from
the requirement of solving the quantum measurement problem. Hence any violation
of Bell's inequality necessarily implies nonlocality because of the measurement
problem. The differences in the implications of deterministic and stochastic
formulations of Bell's inequality are highlighted. The reality condition used
in Bell's inequality is shown to be a generalisation of Einstein's later form
of realism.
