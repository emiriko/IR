We prove that the linearization of a germ of holomorphic map of the type
$F_\lambda(z)=\lambda(z+O(z^2))$ has a $ C^1$--holomorphic dependence on the
multiplier $\lambda$. $C^1$--holomorphic functions are $ C^1$--Whitney smooth
functions, defined on compact subsets and which belong to the kernel of the
$\bar{\partial}$ operator. The linearization is analytic for $|\lambda|\not= 1$
and the unit circle $S^1$ appears as a natural boundary (because of resonances,
i.e. roots of unity). However the linearization is still defined at most points
of $S^1$, namely those points which lie ``far enough from resonances'', i.e.
when the multiplier satisfies a suitable arithmetical condition. We construct
an increasing sequence of compacts which avoid resonances and prove that the
linearization belongs to the associated spaces of ${\cal C}^1$--holomorphic
functions. This is a special case of Borel's theory of uniform monogenic
functions, and the corresponding function space is arcwise-quasianalytic. Among
the consequences of these results, we can prove that the linearization admits
an asymptotic expansion w.r.t. the multiplier at all points of the unit circle
verifying the Brjuno condition: in fact the asymptotic expansion is of Gevrey
type at diophantine points.
