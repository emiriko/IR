In a recent paper, Subbaraman et al report a theoretical and numerical study
of highly dispersive pure silica photonic crystal fiber supporting
group-velocity dispersion exceeding -2*10^4 ps/nm/km. This comment argues that
the authors only consider one out of the two sides of the same coin, by not
taking the corresponding beating length into account.
