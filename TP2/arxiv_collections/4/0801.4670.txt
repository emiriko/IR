The irradiation of SrTiO$_3$ single crystals with swift heavy ions leads to
modifications of the surface. The details of the morphology of these
modifications depends strongly on the angle of incidence and can be
characterized by atomic force microscopy. At glancing angles, discontinuous
chains of nanosized hillocks appear on the surface. The latent track radius can
be determined from the variation of the length of the chains with the angle of
incidence. This radius is material specific and allows the calculation of the
electron-phonon-coupling constant for SrTiO$_3$. We show that a theoretical
description of the nanodot creation is possible within a two-temperature model
if the spatial electron density is taken into account. The appearance of
discontinuous features can be explained easily within this model, but it turns
out that the electronic excitation dissipates on a femtosecond time scale and
thus too rapidly to feed sufficient energy into the phonon system in order to
induce a thermal melting process. We demonstrate that this can be solved if the
temperature dependent diffusion coefficient is introduced into the model.
