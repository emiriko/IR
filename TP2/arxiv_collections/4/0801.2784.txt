The nucleon magnetic moment is calculated in the epsilon-regime of Heavy
Baryon Chiral Perturbation Theory to order epsilon^3, using the method of
collective variables to integrate nonperturbative pion zero modes.
Contributions containing multiple sources of zero modes enter, allowing for
charge-carrying zero mode pion fields that connect the sources. The result of
this calculation will allow for lattice QCD calculations involving nucleons to
systematically extract the leading low energy coefficients of Heavy Baryon
Chiral Perturbation Theory with electromagnetic interactions.
