We investigate Voronoi-like tessellations of bipartite quadrangulations on
surfaces of arbitrary genus, by using a natural generalization of a bijection
of Marcus and Schaeffer allowing to encode such structures into labeled maps
with a fixed number of faces. We investigate the scaling limits of the latter.
Applications include asymptotic enumeration results for quadrangulations, and
typical metric properties of randomly sampled quadrangulations. In particular,
we show that scaling limits of these random quadrangulations are such that
almost every pair of points are linked by a unique geodesic.
