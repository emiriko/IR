In this paper, we derive the virtual structure constants used in mirror
computation of degree k hypersurface in CP^{N-1}, by using localization
computation applied to moduli space of polynomial maps from CP^{1} to CP^{N-1}
with two marked points. We also apply this technique to non-nef local geometry
O(1)+O(-3)->CP^{1} and realize mirror computation without using Birkhoff
factorization.
