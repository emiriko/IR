Current community detection algorithms operate by optimizing a statistic
called modularity, which analyzes the distribution of positively weighted edges
in a network. Modularity does not account for negatively weighted edges. This
paper introduces a dual assortative modularity measure (DAMM) that incorporates
both positively and negatively weighted edges. We describe the the DAMM
statistic and illustrate its utility in a community detection algorithm. We
evaluate the efficacy of the algorithm on both computer generated and
real-world networks, showing that DAMM broadens the domain of networks that can
be analyzed by community detection algorithms.
