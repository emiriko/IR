The type IIA nonsupersymmetric meta-stable brane configuration consisting of
three NS5-branes, D4-branes and anti-D4-branes where the electric gauge theory
superpotential has a quartic term for the bifundamentals besides a mass term is
constructed. By adding the orientifold 4-plane and 6-plane to this brane
configuration, we also describe the intersecting brane configurations of type
IIA string theory corresponding to the meta-stable nonsupersymmetric vacua of
corresponding gauge theories.
