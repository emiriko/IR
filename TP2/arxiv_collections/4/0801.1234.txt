The classic "Bell's Theorem" of Clauser, Holt, Shimony and Horne tells us
that we must give up at least one of: (1) objective reality (aka "hidden
variables"); (2) locality; or (3) time-forwards macroscopic statistics (aka
"causality"). The orthodox Copenhagen version of physics gives up the first.
The many-worlds theory of Everett and Wheeler gives up the second. The
backwards-time theory of physics (BTP) gives up the third. Contrary to
conventional wisdom, empirical evidence strongly favors Everett-Wheeler over
orthodox Copenhagen. BTP has two major variations -- a many-worlds version, and
a neoclassical version of partial differential equations (PDE) in the spirit of
Einstein. Section 2 discusses quantum measurement according to BTP, focusing on
how we represent condensed matter objects like polarizers in a Bell's Theorem
experiment or in tests of Hawking's cosmology. The Backwards Time Telegraph,
though speculative, is discussed.
