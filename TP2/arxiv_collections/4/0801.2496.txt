We start with definitions of the general notions of the theory of $\Bbb
Z_{2}$-graded algebras. Then we consider theory of inductive families of $\Bbb
Z_{2}$-graded semisimple finite-dimensional algebras and its representations in
the spirit of approach of the papers \cite{VO,OV} to representation theory of
symmetric groups. The main example is the classical - theory of the projective
representations of symmetric groups.
