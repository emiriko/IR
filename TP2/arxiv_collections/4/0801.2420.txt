From the perspective of information theory and cryptography, we analyze the
security of two quantum dialogue protocols and a bidirectional quantum secure
direct communication (QSDC) protocol, and point out that the transmitted
information would be partly leaked out in them. That is, any eavesdropper can
elicit some information about the secrets from the public annunciations of the
legal users. This phenomenon should have been strictly forbidden in a quantum
secure communication. In fact, this problem exists in quite a few recent
proposals and, therefore, it deserves more research attention in the following
related study.
