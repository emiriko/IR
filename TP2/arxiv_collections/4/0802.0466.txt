Hagelstein and Chaudhary have recently criticized our low energy nuclear
reaction rates in chemical cells based on our computed electron mass
renormalization for surface electrons of metal hydride electrodes. They further
criticize our electron mass renormalization in exploding wire systems which is
very strange because mass renormalization was {\em never even mentioned} in our
exploding wire work. Here we show that the calculations of Hagelstein and
Chaudhary are erroneous in that they are in conflict with the Gauss law, i.e.
they have arbitrarily removed all Coulomb interactions in electromagnetic
propagators. They have also ignored substantial Ampere interactions in favor of
computing only totally negligible contributions. When the fallacious
considerations of Hagelstein and Chaudhary are clearly exposed, it becomes
evident that our previous calculations remain valid.
