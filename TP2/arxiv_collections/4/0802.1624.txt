Tachyon condensation in topological Landau-Ginzburg models can generally be
studied using methods of commutative algebra and properties of triangulated
categories. The efficiency of this approach is demonstrated by explicitly
proving that every D-brane system in all minimal models of type ADE can be
generated from only one or two fundamental branes.
