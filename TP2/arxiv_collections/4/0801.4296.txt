We consider the classical dynamics of a particle in a $d=2,3$-dimensional
space-periodic potential under the influence of time-periodic external fields
with zero mean. We perform a general time-space symmetry analysis and identify
conditions, when the particle will generate a nonzero averaged translational
and vortex currents. We perform computational studies of the equations of
motion and of corresponding Fokker-Planck equations, which confirm the symmetry
predictions. We address the experimentally important issue of current control.
Cold atoms in optical potentials and magnetic traps are among possible
candidates to observe these findings experimentally.
