We have studied the magnetic characteristics of a series of super-oxygenated
La2-xSrxCuO4+y samples. As shown in previous work, these samples spontaneously
phase separate into an oxygen rich superconducting phase with a TC near 40 K
and an oxygen poor magnetic phase that also orders near 40 K. All samples
studied are highly magnetically reversible even to low temperatures. Although
the internal magnetic regions of these samples might be expected to act as
pinning sites, our present study shows that they do not favor flux pinning.
Flux pinning requires a matching condition between the defect and the
superconducting coherence length. Thus, our results imply that the magnetic
regions are too large to act as pinning centers. This also implies that the
much greater flux pinning in typical La2-xSrxCuO4 materials is the result of
nanoscale inhomogeneities that grow to become the large magnetic regions in the
super-oxygenated materials. The superconducting regions of the phase separated
materials are in that sense cleaner and more homogenous than in the typical
cuprate superconductor.
