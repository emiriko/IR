The name graph state is used to describe a certain class of pure quantum
state which models a physical structure on which one can perform
measurement-based quantum computing, and which has a natural graphical
description. We present the two-graph state, this being a generalisation of the
graph state and a two-graph representation of a stabilizer state.
Mathematically, the two-graph state can be viewed as a simultaneous
generalisation of a binary linear code and quadratic Boolean function. It
describes precisely the coefficients of the pure quantum state vector resulting
from the action of a member of the local Clifford group on a graph state, and
comprises a graph which encodes the magnitude properties of the state, and a
graph encoding its phase properties. This description facilitates a
computationally efficient spectral analysis of the graph state with respect to
operations from the local Clifford group on the state, as all operations can be
realised graphically. By focusing on the so-called local transform group, which
is a size 3 cyclic subgroup of the local Clifford group over one qubit, and
over $n$ qubits is of size $3^n$, we can efficiently compute spectral
properties of the graph state.
