Spontaneous parametric down conversion has been largely exploited as a tool
for absolute calibration of photon counting detectors, photomultiplier tubes or
avalanche photodiodes working in Geiger regime. In this work we investigate the
extension of this technique from very low photon flux of photon counting regime
to the absolute calibration of analog photodetectors at higher photon flux.
Moving toward higher photon rate, i.e. at high gain regime, with the
spontaneous parametric down conversion shows intrinsic limitations of the
method, while the stimulated parametric down conversion process, where a seed
beam properly injected into the crystal in order to increase the photon
generation rate in the conjugate arm, allows us to work around this problem. A
preliminary uncertainty budget is discussed.
