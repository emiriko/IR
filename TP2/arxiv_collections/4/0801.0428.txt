We consider the effects of departures from minimal flavour violations (MFV)
in the context of CMSSM-like theories. Second and third generation off-diagonal
elements in the Yukawa, sfermion, and trilinear mass matrices are taken to be
non-zero at the GUT scale. These are run down together with MSSM parameters to
the electroweak scale. We apply constraints from fermion masses and CKM matrix
elements to limit the range of the new free parameters of the model. We
determine the effect of the departure from MFV on the branching ratio of b->s
gamma. We find that only when the expansion parameter in the down-squark sector
is relatively large there is a noticeable effect, which tends to relax the
lower limit from b->s gamma on the universal gaugino mass. We also find that
the expansion parameter associated with the slepton sector needs to be smaller
than the corresponding parameter in the down-squark sector in order to be
compliant with the bound imposed by the branching ratio of tau-> mu gamma.
