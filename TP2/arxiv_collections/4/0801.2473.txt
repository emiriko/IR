We use the fidelity approach to quantum critical points to study the zero
temperature phase diagram of the one-dimensional Hubbard model. Using a variety
of analytical and numerical techniques, we analyze the fidelity metric in
various regions of the phase diagram, with particular care to the critical
points. Specifically we show that close to the Mott transition, taking place at
on-site repulsion U=0 and electron density n=1, the fidelity metric satisfies
an hyper-scaling form which we calculate. This implies that in general, as one
approaches the critical point U=0, n=1, the fidelity metric tends to a limit
which depends on the path of approach. At half filling, the fidelity metric is
expected to diverge as U^{-4} when U is sent to zero.
