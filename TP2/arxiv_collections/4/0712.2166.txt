The basic principles of detection of fast neutrons with liquid scintillator
detectors are reviewed, together with a real example in the form of the Neutron
Wall array. Two of the challenges in neutron detection, discrimination of
neutrons and gamma rays and identification of cross talk between detectors due
to neutron scattering, are briefly discussed, as well as possible solutions to
these problems. The possibilities of using digital techniques for pulse-shape
discrimination are examined. Results from a digital and analog versions of the
zero cross-over algorithm are presented. The digital pulse-shape discrimination
is shown to give, at least, as good results as the corresponding analogue
version.
