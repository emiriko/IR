We found that multiple circular walls (MCW) can be generated on a thin film
of a nematic liquid crystal through a spiral scanning of a focused IR laser.
The ratios between radii of adjacent rings of MCW were almost constant. These
constant ratios can be explained theoretically by minimization of the Frank
elastic free energy of nematic medium. The director field on a MCW exhibits
chiral symmetry-breaking although the elastic free energies of both chiral MCWs
are degenerated, i.e., the director on a MCW can rotate clockwise or
counterclockwise along the radial direction.
