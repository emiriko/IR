It is a well known fact that non-trivial boundary conditions affect the
interaction between atoms and the always present quantized electromagnetic
field. In this paper, we focus on how the spontaneous emission rate of a given
excited atom is altered when placed inside a perfectly conducting wedge. We
begin by briefly presenting the formalism on which our calculations are
founded, proceeding then to a long but straightforward calculation of the
transition rate. We present results for a general atom but, for the sake of
simplicity, we narrow them down to an effective two-level system in our
numerical investigations. From these we conclude that the results are
physically sound.
