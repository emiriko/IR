The theta term that breaks the Strong CP symmetry is introduced in the two
flavors of dynamical QCD simulation. theta is analytically continued to a pure
imaginary number to make the probability of Monte Carlo positive. The Neutron's
Electric Dipole Moment (NEDM) is measured on the ensemble under a uniform and
week electric field. Other applications of theta terms are also discussed.
