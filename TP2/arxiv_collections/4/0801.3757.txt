Correlation between dielectric and magnetic properties was investigated on
the triangular lattice antiferromagnets ACrO2 (A= Cu, Ag, Li, or Na) showing
120-degree spiral spin structure with easy-axis anisotropy. For the A= Cu and
Ag compounds with delafossite structure, ferroelectric polarization emerges
upon the spiral spin order, implying the strong coupling between the
ferroelectricity and spiral spin structure. On the other hand, for the A = Li
and Na compounds with ordered rock salt structure, no polarization but only
clear anomalies in dielectric constant can be observed upon the spiral spin
order. The absence of polarization can be interpreted as the antiferroelectric
state induced by the alternate stacking of Cr3+ layer with opposite spin vector
chirality. These results imply that a vast range of trigonally stacked
triangular-lattice systems with 120-degree spin structure can be multiferroic,
irrespective of their magnetic anisotropy.
