We apply the recent results of F. Hiai, M. Mosonyi and T. Ogawa
[arXiv:0707.2020, to appear in J. Math. Phys.] to the asymptotic hypothesis
testing problem of locally faithful shift-invariant quasi-free states on a CAR
algebra. We use a multivariate extension of Szego's theorem to show the
existence of the mean Chernoff and Hoeffding bounds and the mean relative
entropy, and show that these quantities arise as the optimal error exponents in
suitable settings.
