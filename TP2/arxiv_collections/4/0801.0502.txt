In this paper we study the flat (k=0) cosmological FRW model with holonomy
corrections of Loop Quantum Gravity. The considered universe contains a
massless scalar field and the cosmological constant Lambda. We find analytical
solutions for this model in different configurations and investigate its
dynamical behaviour in the whole phase space. We show the explicit influence of
Lambda on the qualitative and quantitative character of solutions. Even in the
case of positive Lambda the oscillating solutions without the initial and final
singularity appear as a generic case for some quantisation schemes.
