Quantum teleportation using neutral pseudoscalar mesons shows novel
connections between particle physics and quantum information. The projection
basis, which is crucial in the teleportation process, is determined by the
conservation laws of particle physics, and is different from the Bell basis, as
in the usual case. Here we show that one can verify the teleportation process
by CP measurement. This method significantly simplifies the high energy quantum
teleportation protocol. Especially, it is rigorous, and is independent of
whether CP is violated in weak decays. This method can also be applied to
general verification of Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen correlations in particle
physics.
