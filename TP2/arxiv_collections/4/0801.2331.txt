From Hamilton's principle of stationary action, we derive governing equations
of two-fluid mixtures and extend the model to the dissipative case without
chemical reactions. For both conservative and dissipative cases, an algebraic
identity connecting equations of momentum, mass, energy and entropy is obtained
by extending the Gibbs identity in dynamics. The obtained system is hyperbolic
for small relative velocity of the phases.
