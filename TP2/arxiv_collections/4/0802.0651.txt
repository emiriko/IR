A theory is developed to describe the superfluid turbulence on the base of
kinetics of the merging and splitting vortex loops. Because of very frequent
reconnections the vortex loops (as a whole) do not live long enough to perform
any essential evolution due to the deterministic motion. On the contrary, they
rapidly merge and split, and these random recombination processes prevail over
other slower dynamic processes. To develop quantitative description we take the
vortex loops to have a Brownian structure with the only degree of freedom,
which is the length $l$ of the loop. We perform investigation on the base of
the Boltzmann type kinetic equation for the distribution function $n(l)$ of
number of loops with length $l$. By use of the special ansatz in the collision
integral we have found the exact power-like solution to kinetic equation in the
stationary case. This solution is not (thermodynamically) equilibrium, but on
the contrary, it describes the state with two mutual fluxes of the length (or
energy) in space of sizes of the vortex loops. The term flux means just
redistribution of length (or energy) among the loops of different sizes due to
reconnections. Analyzing this solution we drew several results on the structure
and dynamics of the vortex tangle in the turbulent superfluid helium. In
particular, we evaluated the mean radius of the curvature and the full rate of
the reconnection events. We also studied the evolution of the full length of
vortex loops per unit volume-the so-called vortex line density. It is shown
this evolution to obey the famous Vinen equation. The properties of the Vinen
equation from the point of view of the developed approach had been discussed.
