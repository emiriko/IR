We present a simple method to automatically evaluate arbitrary tree-level
amplitudes involving the production or decay of a heavy quark pair QQbar in a
generic {2S+1}L_J^[1,8] state, i.e., the short distance coefficients appearing
in the NRQCD factorization formalism. Our approach is based on extracting the
relevant contributions from the open heavy quark-antiquark amplitudes through
an expansion with respect to the quark-antiquark relative momentum and the
application of suitable color and spin projectors. To illustrate the
capabilities of the method and its implementation in MadGraph a few
applications to quarkonium collider phenomenology are presented.
