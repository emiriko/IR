Chiral symmetry is an essential concept in understanding QCD at low energy.
We treat the chiral condensate, which measures the spontaneous breaking of
chiral symmetry, as a free parameter to investigate the effect of partially
restored chiral symmetry on the physical quantities in the frame work of an
AdS/QCD model. We observe an interesting scaling behavior among the nucleon
mass, pion decay constant and chiral condensate. We propose a phenomenological
way to introduce the temperature dependence of a physical quantity in the
AdS/QCD model with the thermal AdS metric.
