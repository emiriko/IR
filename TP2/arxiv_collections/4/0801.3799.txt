Traditional searches for SUSY at hadron colliders rely heavily on the
presence of large missing transverse energy (ME_T) to reject background
compared to signal. On the other hand, initial searches for new physics at the
LHC may not be able to rely on ME_T due to a variety of detector calibration
issues. We show that much of SUSY parameter space is accessible to discovery
even {\it without} using ME_T, and with rather low integrated luminosities
0.1-1 fb^{-1}. A key role is played by isolated lepton multiplicity which
arises from gluino and squark cascade decays. Requiring \ge 3 isolated leptons
plus jets yields a high rate of background rejection compared to signal. We
find an LHC reach in m(gluino) of about 700-750 GeV for just 0.1 fb^{-1} of
integrated luminosity by requiring events with \ge 4 jets plus \ge 3 isolated
leptons but {\it without} using ME_T. If a large enough event sample is
assembled, then kinematic reconstruction of sparticle mass properties should be
possible just as in the case where large ME_T is required. SUSY without ME_T
can also be seen in opposite-sign/same flavor {\it dilepton plus jets} events
when a characteristic invariant mass edge stands out against background.
