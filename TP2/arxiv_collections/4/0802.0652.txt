The Mathisson equations under the Frenkel-Mathisson supplementary condition
are studied in a Schwarzschild field. The choice of solutions, which describe
the motions of the proper center of mass of a spinning test particle, is
discussed, and the calculation procedure for highly relativistic motions is
proposed. The very motions are important for astrophysics while investigating
possible effects of the gravitational spin-orbit interaction on the particle's
world line and trajectory.
