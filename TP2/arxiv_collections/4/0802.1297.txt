Dynamics of vortices in strongly type-II superconductors with strong disorder
is investigated within the frustrated three-dimensional XY model. For two
typical models in [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 91}, 077002 (2003)] and [Phys. Rev. B
{\bf 68}, 220502(R) (2003)], a strong evidence for the finite temperature
vortex glass transition in the unscreened limit is provided by performing
large-scale dynamical simulations. The obtained correlation length exponents
and the dynamic exponents in both models are different from each other and from
those in the three-dimensional gauge glass model. In addition, a genuine
continuous depinning transition is observed at zero temperature for both
models. A scaling analysis for the thermal rounding of the depinning transition
shows a non-Arrhenius type creep motion in the vortex glass phase, contrarily
to the recent studies..
