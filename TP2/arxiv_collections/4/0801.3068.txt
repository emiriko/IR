The superconducting transition temperature (TC) in nanostructured Pb remains
nearly constant as the particle size is reduced from 65 to 7nm, below which
size the superconductivity is lost rather abruptly. In contrast, there is a
large enhancement in the upper critical field (HC2) in the same size regime. We
explore the origin of the unusual robustness of the TC over such a large
particle size range in nanostructured Pb, by measuring the temperature
dependence of the superconducting energy gap in planar tunnel junctions of
Al/Al2O3/nano-Pb. We show that below 22nm, the electron phonon coupling
strength increases monotonically with decreasing particle size, and almost
exactly compensates for the quantum size effect, which is expected to suppress
TC.
