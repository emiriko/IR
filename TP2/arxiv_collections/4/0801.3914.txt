We apply our first-principles method to simulate the transient electrical
response through carbon nanotube based conductors under time-dependent bias
voltages, and report the dynamic conductance for a specific system. We find
that the electrical response of the carbon nanotube device can be mapped onto
an equivalent classical electric circuit. This is confirmed by studying the
electric response of a simple model system and its equivalent circuit.
