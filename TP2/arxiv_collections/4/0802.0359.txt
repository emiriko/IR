In [LW], we construct examples of two-dimensional Hamiltonian stationary
self-shrinkers and self-expanders for Lagrangian mean curvature flows, which
are asymptotic to the union of two Schoen-Wolfson cones. These self-shrinkers
and self-expanders can be glued together to yield solutions of the Brakke flow
- a weak formulation of the mean curvature flow. Moreover, there is no mass
loss along the Brakke flow. In this paper, we generalize these results to
higher dimension. We construct new higher dimensional Hamiltonian stationary
cones of different topology as generalizations of the Schoen-Wolfson cones.
Hamiltonian stationary self-shrinkers and self-expanders that are asymptotic to
these Hamiltonian stationary cones are also constructed. They can also be glued
together to produce eternal solutions of the Brakke flow without mass loss.
Finally, we show the same conclusion holds for those Lagrangian self-similar
examples recently found by Joyce, Tsui and the first author in [JLT].
