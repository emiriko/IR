We describe various nonrelativistic contractions of two classes of twisted
Poincare algebra: canonical one ($\theta_{\mu\nu}$-deformation) and the one
leading to Lie-algebraic models of noncommutative space-times. The cases of
contraction-independent and contraction-dependent twist parameters are
considered. We obtain five models of noncommutative nonrelativistic
space-times, in particular, two new Lie-algebraic nonrelativistic deformations
of space-time, respectively, with quantum time/classical space and with quantum
space/classical time.
