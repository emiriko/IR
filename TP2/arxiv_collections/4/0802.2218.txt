In these two lectures, we will address the topic of the creation of small
black holes during particle collisions in a ground-based accelerator, such as
LHC, in the context of a higher-dimensional theory. We will cover the main
assumptions, criteria and estimates for their creation, and we will discuss
their properties after their formation. The most important observable effect
associated with their creation is likely to be the emission of Hawking
radiation during their evaporation process. After presenting the mathematical
formalism for its study, we will review the current results for the emission of
particles both on the brane and in the bulk. We will finish with a discussion
of the methodology that will be used to study these spectra, and the observable
signatures that will help us identify the black-hole events.
