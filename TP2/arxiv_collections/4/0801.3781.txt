We consider a higher dimensional gravity theory with a negative kinetic
energy scalar field and a cosmological constant. We find that the theory admits
an exact cosmological solution for the scale factor of our universe. It has the
feature that the universe undergoes a continuous transition from deceleration
to acceleration at some finite time. This transition time can be interpreted as
that of recent acceleration of our universe.
