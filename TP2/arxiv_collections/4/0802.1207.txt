We construct a family of time-independent nearest-neighbor Hamiltonians
coupling eight-state systems on a 1D ring that enables universal quantum
computation. Hamiltonians in this family can achieve universality either by
driving a continuous-time quantum walk or by terminating an adiabatic
algorithm. In either case, the universality property can be understood as
arising from an efficient simulation of a programmable quantum circuit. Using
gadget perturbation theory, one can demonstrate the same kind of universality
for related Hamiltonian families acting on qubits in 2D. Our results
demonstrate that simulating 1D chains of spin-7/2 particles is BQP-hard, and
indeed BQP-complete because the outputs of decision problems can be encoded in
the outputs of such simulations.
