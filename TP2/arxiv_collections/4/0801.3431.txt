In this paper, we derive a partial result related to a question of Yau: "Does
a simply-connected complete K\"ahler manifold M with negative sectional
curvature admit a bounded non-constant holomorphic function?"
  Main Theorem. Let $M^{2n}$ be a simply-connected complete K\"ahler manifold M
with negative sectional curvature $ \le -1 $ and $S_\infty(M)$ be the sphere at
infinity of $M$. Then there is an explicit {\it bounded} contact form $\beta$
defined on the entire manifold $M^{2n}$.
  Consequently, the sphere $S_\infty(M)$ at infinity of M admits a {\it
bounded} contact structure and a bounded pseudo-Hermitian metric in the sense
of Tanaka-Webster.
  We also discuss several open modified problems of Calabi and Yau for
Alexandrov spaces and CR-manifolds.
