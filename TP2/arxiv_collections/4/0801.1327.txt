This essay tells briefly of the life and work of one of the most successful
scientists originating from a Balkan settlement whose name and popularity have
greatly exceeded its realm. The word is of a discovery during WWII of the
photostimulated aggregation of the F centers (else alkali atoms) dissolved from
the vapor into an alkali halide crystal. Using optical absorption techniques
while a grantee of Humboldt's Foundation in Goettingen, Germany between
1943-1944, he found new absorption bands pertaining to small-size F center
aggregates and followed their interconversions. A primary photochemical solid
state reaction was evidenced for the first time leading to nanoscale products.
