We develop a theory for the renormalization of the phonon energy dispersion
in graphene due to the combined effects of both Coulomb and electron-phonon
(e-ph) interactions. We obtain the renormalized phonon energy spectrum by an
exact analytic derivation of the phonon self-energy, finding three distinct
Kohn anomalies (KAs) at the phonon wavevector $q = \omega/v, 2k_F\pm\omega/v$
for LO phonons and one at $q = \omega/v$ for TO phonons. The presence of these
new KAs in graphene, in contrast to the usual KA $q = 2k_F$ in ordinary metals,
originates from the dynamical screening of e-ph interaction (with a concomitant
breakdown of the Born-Oppenheimer approximation) and the peculiar chirality of
the graphene e-ph coupling.
