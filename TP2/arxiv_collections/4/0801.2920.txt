The peculiarity of the distribution and geometry of metallic ions in enzymes
pushed us to set the hypothesis that metallic ions in active-site act like tiny
antennas able to pick up very feeble e.m. signals. Enzymatic activity of Cu2+,
Zn2+ Superoxide Dismutase (SOD1) and Fe2+ Xanthine Oxidase (XO) has been
studied, following in vitro generation and removal of free radicals. We
observed that Superoxide radicals generation by XO is increased by a weak field
having the Larmor frequency fL of Fe2+ while the SOD1 kinetics is sensibly
reduced by exposure to a weak field having the frequency fL of Cu2+ ion.
