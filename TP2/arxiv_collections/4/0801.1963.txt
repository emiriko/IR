We survey some known results about operator semigroup generated by operator
matrices with diagonal or coupled domain. These abstract results are applied to
the characterization of well-/ill-posedness for a class of evolution equations
with dynamic boundary conditions on domains or metric graphs. In particular,
our ill-posedness results on the heat equation with general Wentzell-type
boundary conditions complement those previously obtained by, among others,
Bandle-von Below-Reichel and Vitillaro-V\'azquez.
