We test some recent conjectures about extremal selfdual CFTs, which are the
candidate holographic duals of pure gravity in $AdS_3$. We prove that no $c=48$
extremal selfdual CFT or SCFT may possess Monster symmetry. Furthermore, we
disprove a recent argument against the existence of extremal selfdual CFTs of
large central charge.
