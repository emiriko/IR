We consider a general model of self-propelling particles interacting through
a pairwise attractive force in the presence of noise and communication time
delay. Previous work by Erdmann, et al. [Phys. Rev. E {\bf 71}, 051904 (2205)]
has shown that a large enough noise intensity will cause a translating swarm of
individuals to transition to a rotating swarm with a stationary center of mass.
We show that with the addition of a time delay, the model possesses a
transition that depends on the size of the coupling amplitude. This transition
is independent of the initial swarm state (traveling or rotating) and is
characterized by the alignment of all of the individuals along with a swarm
oscillation. By considering the mean field equations without noise, we show
that the time delay induced transition is associated with a Hopf bifurcation.
The analytical result yields good agreement with numerical computations of the
value of the coupling parameter at the Hopf point.
