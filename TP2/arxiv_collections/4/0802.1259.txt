This article surveys the relations between harmonic Higgs bundles and Saito
structures which lead to tt* geometry on Frobenius manifolds. We give the main
lines of the proof of the existence of a canonical tt* structure on the base
space of the universal unfolding of convenient and nondegenerate Laurent
polynomials.
