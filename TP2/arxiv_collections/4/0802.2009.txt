The elastocaloric effect in the vicinity of the martensitic transition of a
Cu-Zn-Al has been studied by inducing the transition by strain or stress
measurements. While transition trajectories show significant differences, the
entropy change associated with the whole transformation (\DeltaSt) is
coincident in both kind of experiments since entropy production is small
compared to \DeltaSt. The values agree with estimations based on the Clausius-
Clapeyron equation. The possibility of using these materials for mechanical
refrigeration is also discussed.
