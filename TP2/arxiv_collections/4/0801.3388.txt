We report on numerical studies into the interplay of disorder and
electron-electron interactions within the integer quantum Hall regime, where
the presence of a strong magnetic field and two-dimensional confinement of the
electronic system profoundly affects thermodynamic and transport properties. We
emphasise the behaviour of the electronic compressibility, the local density of
states, and the Kubo conductivity. Our treatment of the electron-electron
interactions relies on the Hartree-Fock approximation so as to achieve system
sizes comparable to experimental situations. Our results clearly exhibit
manifestations of various interaction-mediated features, such as non-linear
screening, local charging, and g-factor enhancement, implying the inadequacy of
independent-particle models for comparison with experimental results.
