Power law scaling is observed in many physical, biological and
socio-economical complex systems and is now considered as an important property
of these systems. In general, power law exists in the central part of the
distribution. It has deviations from power law for very small and very large
step sizes. Tsallis, through non-extensive thermodynamics, explained power law
distribution in many cases including deviation from the power law, both for
small and very large steps. In case of very large steps, they used heuristic
crossover approach. In real systems, the size is limited and thus, the size
limiting factor is important. In the present work, we present an alternative
model in which we consider that the entropy factor q decreases with step size
due to the softening of long range interactions or memory. This explains the
deviation of power law for very large step sizes. Finally, we apply this model
for distribution of citation index of scientists and examination scores and are
able to explain the entire distribution including deviations from power law.
