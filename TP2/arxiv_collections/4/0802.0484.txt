The need for high data rate communication systems has been dramatically
increasing in recent years. The millimeter-wave bands (such as 60 GHz) have
been investigated for wireless high data rate transmission. At these
frequencies, the conductor loss is significant which makes dielectric resonator
antenna (DRA) a good replacement for microstrip patch antennas currently in
use. Moreover, use of silicon as the dielectric material in a DRA provides the
great feature of bandwidth tunability through carrier density modulation. In
this paper, we present experimental and theoretical studies of antennas made
from silicon.
