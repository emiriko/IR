There exist several classes of theories beyond the Standard Model which
contain massive spin-1 color octets, generically called "colorons". Indeed we
argue that colorons inevitably appear in the spectrum whenever new colored
particles feel an additional confining force. Colorons are distinctive at
hadron colliders as this is the only environment in which they can be
resonantly produced. In the simplest models we show that the coloron naturally
decays to multijets via secondary resonances, which can be consistent with all
existing bounds, even for colorons as light as a few hundred GeV. We perform
representative case studies and show that a search in the four-jet channel at
the Tevatron has strong signal significance, while the LHC faces formidable
challenges for such a search.
