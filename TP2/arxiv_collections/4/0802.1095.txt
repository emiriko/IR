Galileo Galilei had sufficient skill as an observer and instrument builder to
be able to measure the positions and apparent sizes of objects seen through his
telescopes to an accuracy of 2" or better. However, Galileo had no knowledge of
wave optics, so when he was measuring stellar apparent sizes he was producing
very accurate measurements of diffraction artifacts and not physical bodies.
