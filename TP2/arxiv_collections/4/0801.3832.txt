It has been proposed that the dynamical stability of topological defects in
the visual cortex reflects the Euclidean symmetry of the visual world. We
analyze defect stability and pattern selection in a generalized Swift-Hohenberg
model of visual cortical development symmetric under the Euclidean group E(2).
Euclidean symmetry strongly influences the geometry and multistability of model
solutions but does not directly impact on defect stability.
