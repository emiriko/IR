The so-called Miccinelli documents are a set of documents which were written
by Jesuit scholars in Peru within the first half of the 17th century. Among
such documents, one contains the depiction of a Quipu, that is, a device made
out of cords of different nature and colors which, with the help of nodes, were
used by the Incas for storing data. This Quipu is claimed by the author, Blas
Valera, to be a reproduction of the Inca calendar of the year of the Spanish
conquest. We give here a complete analysis of the astronomical events occurred
in Cusco in that year, showing that they actually correspond closely to the
data reported in the Quipu, and compare the calendrical information - such as
the names and the rituals of each month - with those given by other documents,
especially the Nuova Coronica by G. Poma de Ayala. The possible relevance of
the document for the knowledge of the original Inca lore of the sky is
discussed in details.
