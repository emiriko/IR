Can supersymmetric models with a moderate stop mass be made consistent with
the negative Higgs boson searches at LEP, while keeping perturbative
unification manifest? The NMSSM achieves this rather easily, but only if extra
matter multiplets filling complete SU(5) representations are present at
intermediate energies. As a concrete example which makes use of this feature,
we give an analytic description of the phenomenology of a constrained NMSSM
close to a Peccei-Quinn symmetry point. The related pseudo-Goldstone boson
appears in decays of the Higgs bosons and possibly of the lightest neutralino,
and itself decays into (b anti-b) and (tau anti-tau).
