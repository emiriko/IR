Finite Unified Theories (FUTs) are N=1 supersymmetric Grand Unified
  Theories that can be made all-loop finite. The requirement of all-loop
finiteness leads to a severe reduction of the free parameters of the theory
and, in turn, to a large number of predictions. FUTs are investigated in the
context of low-energy phenomenology observables. We present a detailed scanning
of the all-loop finite SU(5) FUTs, where we include the theoretical
uncertainties at the unification scale and we apply several phenomenological
constraints. Taking into account the restrictions from the top and bottom quark
masses, we can discriminate between different models. Including further
low-energy constraints such as B physics observables, the bound on the lightest
Higgs boson mass and the cold dark matter density, we determine the predictions
of the allowed parameter space for the Higgs boson sector and the
supersymmetric particle spectrum of the selected model.
