We construct a covariant phase space for rotating weakly isolated horizons in
Einstein-Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory in all (odd) $D\geq5$ dimensions. In
particular, we show that horizons on the corresponding phase space satisfy the
zeroth and first laws of black-hole mechanics. We show that the existence of a
Killing spinor on an isolated horizon in four dimensions (when the Chern-Simons
term is dropped) and in five dimensions requires that the induced (normal)
connection on the horizon has to vanish, and this in turn implies that the
surface gravity and rotation one-form are zero. This means that the
gravitational component of the horizon angular momentum is zero, while the
electromagnetic component (which is attributed to the bulk radiation field) is
unconstrained. It follows that an isolated horizon is supersymmetric only if it
is extremal and nonrotating. A remarkable property of these horizons is that
the Killing spinor only has to exist on the horizon itself. It does not have to
exist off the horizon. In addition, we find that the limit when the surface
gravity of the horizon goes to zero provides a topological constraint.
Specifically, the integral of the scalar curvature of the cross sections of the
horizon has to be positive when the dominant energy condition is satisfied and
the cosmological constant $\Lambda$ is zero or positive, and in particular
rules out the torus topology for supersymmetric isolated horizons (unless
$\Lambda<0$) if and only if the stress-energy tensor $T_{ab}$ is of the form
such that $T_{ab}\ell^{a}n^{b}=0$ for any two null vectors $\ell$ and $n$ with
normalization $\ell_{a}n^{a}=-1$ on the horizon.
