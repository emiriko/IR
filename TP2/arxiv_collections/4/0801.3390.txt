Synchronization control of coupled continuous-time linear systems is studied.
For identical systems that are stabilizable, a linear feedback law obtained via
algebraic Riccati equation is shown to synchronize any fixed directed network
of any number of coupled systems provided that the coupling is strong enough.
The strength of coupling is determined by the smallest distance of a nonzero
eigenvalue of the coupling matrix to the imaginary axis. A dual problem where
detectable systems that are coupled via their outputs is also considered and
solved.
