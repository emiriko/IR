There is a growing interest in producing intense, coherent x-ray radiation
with an adjustable and arbitrary polarization state. In this paper, we study
the crossed undulator scheme (K.-J. Kim, Nucl. Instrum. Methods A {\bf 445},
329 (2000)) for rapid polarization control in a self-amplified spontaneous
emission (SASE) free electron laser (FEL). Because a SASE source is a
temporally chaotic light, we perform a statistical analysis on the state of
polarization using FEL theory and simulations. We show that by adding a small
phase shifter and a short (about 1.3 times the FEL power gain length),
$90^\circ$ rotated planar undulator after the main SASE planar undulator, one
can obtain circularly polarized light -- with over 80% polarization -- near the
FEL saturation.
