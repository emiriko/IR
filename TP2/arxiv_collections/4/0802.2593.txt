We discuss internal structure of an exotic hadron by using fragmentation
functions. The fragmentation functions for the f_0(980) meson are obtained by a
global analysis of e^++e^- \to f_0+X data. Quark configuration of the f_0(980)
could be determined by peak positions and second moments of the obtained
fragmentation functions.
