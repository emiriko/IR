We present a real-time diagrammatic theory for transport through interacting
quantum dots tunnel coupled to normal and superconducting leads. Our
formulation describes both the equilibrium and non-equilibrium superconducting
proximity effect in a quantum dot. We study a three-terminal transistor
geometry, consisting of a single-level quantum dot tunnel coupled to two
phase-biased superconducting leads and one voltage-biased normal lead. We
compute both the Josephson current between the two superconductors and the
Andreev current in the normal lead, and analyze their switching on and off as
well as transitions between 0- and $\pi$-states as a function of gate and bias
voltage. For the limit of large superconducting gaps in the leads, we describe
the formation of Andreev bound states within an exact resummation of all orders
in the tunnel coupling to the superconducting leads, and discuss their
signature in the non-equilibrium Josephson- and Andreev- current and the
quantum-dot charge.
