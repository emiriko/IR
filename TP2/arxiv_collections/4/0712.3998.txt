A classical general relativistic theory possessing magnetic currents, as well
electric ones and admitting massive photons was built up. As the geometric
basis serves a space with Weylian non-metricity and torsion. The theory is
coordinate covariant as well Weyl-gauge covariant. In the limit one obtains the
ordinary Einstein-Maxwell theory.
