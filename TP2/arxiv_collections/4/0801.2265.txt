We present an analysis of $\Omega$, $\Xi$, $\Lambda$ and $\phi$ spectra from
Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$ GeV in terms of distributions of
effective constituent quarks at hadronization. Consistency in quark ratios
derived from various hadron spectra provides clear evidence for hadron
formation dynamics as suggested by quark coalescence or recombination models.
We argue that the constituent quark distribution reflects properties of the
effective partonic degrees of freedom at hadronization. Experimental data
indicate that strange quarks have a transverse momentum distribution flatter
than that of up/down quarks consistent with hydrodynamic expansion in partonic
phase prior to hadronization. After the AMPT model is tuned to reproduce the
strange and up/down quark distributions, the model can describe the measured
spectra of hyperons and $\phi$ mesons very well where hadrons are formed
through dynamical coalescence.
