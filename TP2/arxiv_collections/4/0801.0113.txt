We present the first experimental evidence for the existence of strongly
localized photonic modes due to random two dimensional fluctuations in the
dielectric constant. In one direction, the modes are trapped by ordered Bragg
reflecting mirrors of a planar, one wavelength long, microcavity. In the cavity
plane, they are localized by disorder, which is due to randomness in the
position, composition and sizes of quantum dots located in the anti-node of the
cavity. We extend the theory of disorder induced strong localization of
electron states to optical modes and obtain quantitative agreement with the
main experimental observations.
