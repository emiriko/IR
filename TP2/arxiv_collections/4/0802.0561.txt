We extend a recently developed Hamiltonian formalism for nonlinear wave
interaction processes in spatially periodic dielectric structures to the
far-off-resonant regime, and investigate numerically the three-wave resonance
conditions in a one-dimensional optical medium with $\chi^{(2)}$ nonlinearity.
In particular, we demonstrate that the cascading of nonresonant wave
interaction processes generates an effective $\chi^{(3)}$ nonlinear response in
these systems. We obtain the corresponding coupling coefficients through
appropriate normal form transformations that formally lead to the Zakharov
equation for spatially periodic optical media.
