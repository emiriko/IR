We consider weighted algebras of holomorphic functions on a Banach space. We
determine conditions on a family of weights that assure that the corresponding
weighted space is an algebra or has polynomial Schauder decompositions. We
study the spectra of weighted algebras and endow them with an analytic
structure. We also deal with composition operators and algebra homomorphisms,
in particular to investigate how their induced mappings act on the analytic
structure of the spectrum. Moreover, a Banach-Stone type question is addressed.
