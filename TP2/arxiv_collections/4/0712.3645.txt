Infrared reflectance spectra of an epitaxial Bi2FeCrO6 thin film prepared by
pulsed laser deposition on LaAlO3 substrate were recorded between 10 and 900 K.
No evidence for a phase transition to the paraelectric phase was observed, but
some phonon anomalies were revealed near 600 K. Most of the polar modes exhibit
only a gradual softening, which results in a continuous increase of the static
permittivity on heating. It indicates that the ferroelectric phase transition
should occur somewhere above 900 K. Magnetic measurements performed up to 1000
K, revealed a possible magnetic phase transition between 600 and 800 K, but the
exact critical temperature cannot be determined due to a strong diamagnetic
signal from the substrate. Nevertheless, our experimental data show that the
B-site ordered Bi2FeCrO6 is one of the rare high-temperature multiferroics.
