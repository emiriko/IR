An inhomogeneous backflow transformation for many-particle wave functions is
presented and applied to electrons in atoms, molecules, and solids. We report
variational and diffusion quantum Monte Carlo VMC and DMC energies for various
systems and study the computational cost of using backflow wave functions. We
find that inhomogeneous backflow transformations can provide a substantial
increase in the amount of correlation energy retrieved within VMC and DMC
calculations. The backflow transformations significantly improve the wave
functions and their nodal surfaces.
