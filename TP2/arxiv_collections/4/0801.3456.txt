We consider a generic abelian hidden sector that couples to the Standard
Model only through gauge-invariant renormalizable operators. This allows the
exotic Higgs boson to mix with the Standard Model Higgs boson, and the exotic
abelian gauge boson to mix with the Standard Model hypercharge gauge boson. One
immediate consequence of spontaneous breaking of the hidden sector gauge group
is the possible decay of the lightest Higgs boson into four fermions through
intermediate exotic gauge bosons. We study the implications of this decay for
Higgs boson phenomenology at the Fermilab Tevatron Collider and the CERN Large
Hadron Collider. Our emphasis is on the four lepton final state.
