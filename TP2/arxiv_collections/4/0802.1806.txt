The masses of the ground state and excited heavy tetraquarks with hidden
charm and bottom are calculated within the relativistic diquark-antidiquark
picture. The dynamics of the light quark in a heavy-light diquark is treated
completely relativistically. The diquark structure is taken into account by
calculating the diquark-gluon form factor. New experimental data on
charmonium-like states above the open charm threshold are discussed. The
obtained results indicate that X(3872), Y(4260), Y(4360), Z(4433) and Y(4660)
can be tetraquark states with hidden charm.
