The effect of magnetic domain boundaries displacement induced by electric
field is observed in epitaxial ferrite garnet films (on substrates with the
(210) crystallographic orientation). The effect is odd with respect to the
electric field (the direction of wall displacement changes with the polarity of
the voltage) and even with respect to the magnetization in domains. The
inhomogeneous magnetoelectric interaction as a possible mechanism of the effect
is proposed.
