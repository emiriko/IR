We analyze tolerable quantum bit error rates in secret sharing protocols, and
show that using entangled encoding states is advantageous in the case when the
eavesdropping attacks are local. We also provide a criterion for security in
secret sharing -- a parallel of the Csiszar-Korner criterion in single-receiver
cryptography.
