We study the stability of some homogeneous bundles on P^3 by using their
representations of the quiver associated to the homgeneous bundles on P^3. In
particular we show that homogeneous bundles on P^3 whose support of the quiver
representation is a parallelepiped are stable, for instance the bundles E whose
minimal free resolution is of the kind 0 --> S^{l_1, l_2, l_3} V (t) --> S^{l_1
+s, l_2, l_3} V (t+s) --> E --> 0 are stable.
