We investigate numerically the zero-temperature physics of the
one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model in an incommensurate cosine potential,
recently realized in experiments with cold bosons in optical superlattices L.
Fallani et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 98, 130404, (2007)]. An incommensurate cosine
potential has intermediate properties between a truly periodic and a fully
random potential, displaying a characteristic length scale (the quasi-period)
which is shown to set a finite lower bound to the excitation energy of the
system at special incommensurate fillings. This leads to the emergence of
gapped incommensurate band-insulator (IBI) phases along with gapless Bose-glass
(BG) phases for strong quasi-periodic potential, both for hardcore and softcore
bosons. Enriching the spatial features of the potential by the addition of a
second incommensurate component appears to remove the IBI regions, stabilizing
a continuous BG phase over an extended parameter range. Moreover we discuss the
validity of the local-density approximation in presence of a parabolic trap,
clarifying the notion of a local BG phase in a trapped system; we investigate
the behavior of first- and second-order coherence upon increasing the strength
of the quasi-periodic potential; and we discuss the ab-initio derivation of the
Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian with quasi-periodic potential starting from the
microscopic Hamiltonian of bosons in an incommensurate superlattice.
