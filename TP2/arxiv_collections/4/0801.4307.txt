We combine Artificial Immune Systems 'AIS', technology with Collaborative
Filtering 'CF' and use it to build a movie recommendation system. We already
know that Artificial Immune Systems work well as movie recommenders from
previous work by Cayzer and Aickelin 3, 4, 5. Here our aim is to investigate
the effect of different affinity measure algorithms for the AIS. Two different
affinity measures, Kendalls Tau and Weighted Kappa, are used to calculate the
correlation coefficients for the movie recommender. We compare the results with
those published previously and show that Weighted Kappa is more suitable than
others for movie problems. We also show that AIS are generally robust movie
recommenders and that, as long as a suitable affinity measure is chosen,
results are good.
