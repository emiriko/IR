Recent work in quantum loop cosmology suggests the universe undergoes a
bounce when evolving from a previous collapsing phase. However, with
non-inflationary matter sources, the scenario appears to strongly violate the
holography bound S\leq A/4 during the bounce, where A now represents the
cross-sectional area of the bounce. We also give a simple argument why any
inflationary phase after the bounce is unlikely due to prior dissipation of a
scalar field kinetic energy phase into regular matter components.
