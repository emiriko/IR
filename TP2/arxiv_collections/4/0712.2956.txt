We consider ultracold atoms in a far detuned optical lattice orientated
across a high-Q optical resonator. Applying an external driving laser to the
atoms, which is red detuned from the cavity mode by one vibrational quantum,
induces cavity-enhanced sideband cooling. For a dense and cold enough atomic
ensemble we predict an oscillation threshold for optical Raman sideband lasing
concurrent with coherent matter-wave amplification. Above this oscillation
threshold photons and atoms in the lowest band are dominantly created pairwise
via stimulated emission with a strong suppression of competing spontaneous
processes. In close analogy to a nondegenerate parametric oscillator we find
sub-Poissonian photon statistics and almost perfect nonclassical atom-photon
number correlations. Injecting atoms in higher vibrational bands via tunneling
or incoherent scattering then leads to continuous, simultaneous generation of a
coherent atom beam and laser light with nonclassical atom-field correlations.
