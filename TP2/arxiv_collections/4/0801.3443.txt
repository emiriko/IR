It is known that a large, charged body immersed in a solution of multivalent
counterions may undergo charge inversion as the counterions adsorb to its
surface. We use the theory of charge inversion to examine the case of a
deformable, porous macroion which may adsorb multivalent ions into its bulk to
form a three-dimensional strongly-correlated liquid. This adsorption may lead
to non-monotonic changes in the size of the macroion as multivalent ions are
added to the solution. The macroion first shrinks as its bare charge is
screened and then reswells as the adsorbed ions invert the sign of the net
charge. We derive a value for the outward pressure experienced by such a
macroion as a function of the ion concentration in solution. We find that for
small deviations in the concentration of multivalent ions away from the neutral
point (where the net charge of the body is zero), the swollen size grows
parabolically with the logarithm of the ratio of multivalent ion concentration
to the concentration at the neutral point.
