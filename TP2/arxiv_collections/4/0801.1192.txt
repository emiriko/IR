We report observations of tunneling anisotropic magnetoresitance (TAMR) in
vertical tunnel devices with a ferromagnetic multilayer-(Co/Pt) electrode and a
non-magnetic Pt counter-electrode separated by an AlOx barrier. In stacks with
the ferromagnetic electrode terminated by a Co film the TAMR magnitude
saturates at 0.15% beyond which it shows only weak dependence on the magnetic
field strength, bias voltage, and temperature. For ferromagnetic electrodes
terminated by two monolayers of Pt we observe order(s) of magnitude enhancement
of the TAMR and a strong dependence on field, temperature and bias. Discussion
of experiments is based on relativistic ab initio calculations of magnetization
orientation dependent densities of states of Co and Co/Pt model systems.
