We construct a practically implementable classical processing for the BB84
protocol and the six-state protocol that fully utilizes the accurate channel
estimation method, which is also known as the quantum tomography. Our proposed
processing yields at least as high key rate as the standard processing by Shor
and Preskill. We show two examples of quantum channels over which the key rate
of our proposed processing is strictly higher than the standard processing. In
the second example, the BB84 protocol with our proposed processing yields a
positive key rate even though the so-called error rate is higher than the 25%
limit.
