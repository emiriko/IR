At present, there are discrepancies between the measurements of several
observables in B-->pi K decays and the predictions of the standard model (the
``B-->pi K puzzle''). Although the effect is not yet statistically significant
-- it is at the level of $\gsim 3\sigma$ -- it does hint at the presence of new
physics. In this paper, we explore whether supersymmetry (SUSY) can explain the
B-->pi K puzzle. In particular, we consider the SUSY model of Grossman, Neubert
and Kagan (GNK). We find that it is extremely unlikely that GNK explains the
B-->pi K data. We also find a similar conclusion in many other models of SUSY.
And there are serious criticisms of the two SUSY models that do reproduce the
B-->pi K data. If the B-->pi K puzzle remains, it could pose a problem for SUSY
models.
