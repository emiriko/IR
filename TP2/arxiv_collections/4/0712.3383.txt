Virus trafficking is fundamental for infection success and plasmid cytosolic
trafficking is a key step of gene delivery. Based on the main physical
properties of the cellular transport machinery such as microtubules, motor
proteins, our goal here is to derive a mathematical model to study cytoplasmic
trafficking. Because experimental results reveal that both active and passive
movement are necessary for a virus to reach the cell nucleus, by taking into
account the complex interactions of the virus with the microtubules, we derive
here an estimate of the mean time a virus reaches the nucleus. In particular,
we present a mathematical procedure in which the complex viral movement,
oscillating between pure diffusion and a deterministic movement along
microtubules, can be approximated by a steady state stochastic equation with a
constant effective drift. An explicit expression for the drift amplitude is
given as a function of the real drift, the density of microtubules and other
physical parameters. The present approach can be used to model viral
trafficking inside the cytoplasm, which is a fundamental step of viral
infection, leading to viral replication and in some cases to cell damage.
