We study a particular example considered in {[Phys. Rev. A {\bf 59,} 1799
(1999)]}, concerning the statistical inference of quantum entanglement using
the Jaynes principle. Assume a Clauser-Horne-Simony-Holt (CHSH) Bell operator,
a sum of two operators $\sqrt{2}(X+Z)$. Given only an average of the Bell-CHSH
operator, we may overestimate entanglement. However, the estimated entanglement
is decreased (never increases) when we use the expectation value of the
operator $X$ as additional information. A minimum entanglement state is
obtained by minimizing the variance of the observable $X$.
