This note is a follow up of math.AG/0612267v2 and it is largely inspired by a
beautiful description of Baker-Norine of non-effective degree (g-1) divisors
via chip-firing game. We consider the set of all theta characteristics on a
tropical curve and identify the Riemann constant as a unique non-effective one
among them.
