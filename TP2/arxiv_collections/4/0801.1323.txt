Using a pi-orbital tight-binding model, we study the elastic and
photoassisted transport properties of metal-molecule-metal junctions based on
oligophenylenes of varying lengths. The effect of monochromatic light is
modeled with an ac voltage over the contact. We first show how the low-bias
transmission function can be obtained analytically, using methods previously
employed for simpler chain models. In particular, the decay coefficient of the
off-resonant transmission is extracted by considering both a finite-length
chain and infinitely extended polyphenylene. Based on these analytical results,
we discuss the length-dependence of the linear-response conductance, the
thermopower, and the light-induced enhancement of the conductance in the limit
of weak intensity and low frequency. In general the conductance-enhancement is
calculated numerically as a function of the light frequency. Finally, we
compute the current-voltage characteristics at finite dc voltages, and show
that in the low-voltage regime, the effect of low-frequency light is to induce
current steps with a voltage separation determined by twice the frequency.
These effects are more pronounced for longer molecules. We study two different
profiles for the dc and ac voltages, and it is found that the results are
robust with respect to such variations. Although we concentrate here on the
specific model of oligophenylenes, the results should be qualitatively similar
for many other organic molecules with a large enough electronic gap.
