We construct axially symmetric, rotating boson stars with positive and
negative parity. Their flat space limits represent spinning Q-balls. $Q$-balls
and boson stars exist only in a limited frequency range. The coupling to
gravity gives rise to a spiral-like frequency dependence of the mass and charge
of boson stars. We analyze the properties of these solutions. In particular, we
discuss the presence of ergoregions in boson stars, and determine their domains
of existence.
