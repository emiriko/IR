Subject of this paper is the thermal investigation of epoxy (EDA) and solder
(SDA) die attaches by a comparison of an ASIC with multiple heat sources in
different package assemblies. Static and transient thermal measurements and
simulations were performed to investigate the thermal behavior of two samples
in a state of the art QFP power package differing only in the die attach
material (EDA and SDA).
