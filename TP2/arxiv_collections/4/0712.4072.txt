A Beta-beam would be a high intensity source of pure $\nu_e$ and/or
$\bar\nu_e$ flux with known spectrum, ideal for precision measurements. Myriad
of possible set-ups with suitable choices of baselines, detectors and the
beta-beam neutrino source with desired energies have been put forth in the
literature. In this talk we present a comparitive discussion of the physics
reach of a few such experimental set-ups.
