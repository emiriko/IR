We introduce a feedback control algorithm that increases the speed at which a
measurement extracts information about a $d$-dimensional system by a factor
that scales as $d^2$. Generalizing this algorithm, we apply it to a register of
$n$ qubits and show an improvement O(n). We derive analytical bounds on the
benefit provided by the feedback and perform simulations that confirm that this
speedup is achieved.
