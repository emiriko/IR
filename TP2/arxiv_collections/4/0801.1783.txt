We use erasers-like basic operations on words to construct a set that is both
Borel and above Delta^0_omega, built as a set V^\omega where V is a language of
finite words accepted by a pushdown automaton. In particular, this gives a
first example of an omega-power of a context free language which is a Borel set
of infinite rank.
