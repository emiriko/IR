We present a detailed analysis of the general exact solution of Einstein's
equation corresponding to a static and plane symmetric distribution of matter
with density proportional to pressure. We study the geodesics in it and we show
that this simple spacetime exhibits very curious properties. In particular, it
has a free of matter repelling singular boundary and all geodesics bounce off
it.
