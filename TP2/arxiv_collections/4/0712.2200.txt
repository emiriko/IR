The study of the interaction of hadrons, produced by elementary probes in a
nucleus, with the surrounding nuclear medium can give insight into two
important questions. First, at high energies, the production process, the
time-scales connected with it and the prehadronic interactions can be studied
by using the nuclear radius as a length-scale. We do this here by analyzing
data from the EMC and HERMES experiements on nuclear attenuation. Second, at
low energies the spectral function, and thus the selfenergy of the produced
hadron, can be studied. Specifically, we analyze the CBELSA/TAPS data on
$\omega$ production in nuclei and discuss the importance of understanding
in-medium effects both on the primary production cross section and the final
state branching ratio. In both of these studies an excellent control of the
final state interactions is essential.
