Peculiarity in the cyclotron radiation and emission in graphene is
theoretically examined in terms of the optical conductivity and relaxation
rates to propose that graphene in magnetic fields can be a candidate to realize
the Landau level laser, proposed decades ago [H. Aoki, Appl. Phys. Lett. {\bf
48}, 559 (1986)].
