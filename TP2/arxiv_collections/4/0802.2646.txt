Single-particle potentials in Hartree-Fock approximation for different
hyperon-nucleon (YN) channels are calculated in the framework of the effective
low-momentum YN interaction V_lowk. In contrast to the nucleon-nucleon
interaction, the available experimental data for the YN interaction are scarce.
As a consequence no unique YN low-momentum potential V_lowk can be predicted
from the various bare potentials. The resulting momentum- and density-dependent
single-particle potentials for several different bare OBE models and for chiral
effective field theory are compared to each other.
