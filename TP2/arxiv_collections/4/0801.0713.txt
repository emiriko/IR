We investigate the subarea law scaling properties of the block entropy in
bipartite fermionic systems which do not have a finite Fermi surface. It is
found that in gapped regimes the leading subarea term is a negative constant,
whereas in critical regimes with point nodes the leading subarea law is a
logarithmic additive term. At the phase boundary that separates the critical
and non-critical regimes, the subarea scaling shows power-law behavior.
