We look at AG codes associated to the projective line, re-examining the
problem of determining their automorphism groups (originally investigated by
Duer in 1987 using combinatorial techniques) using recent methods from
algebraic geometry. We (re)classify those finite groups that can arise as the
automorphism group of an AG code for the projective line and give an explicit
description of how these groups appear. We also give examples of generalized
Reed-Solomon codes with large automorphism groups G, such as G=PSL(2,q), and
explicitly describe their G-module structure.
