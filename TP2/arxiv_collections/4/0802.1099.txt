Complex computer codes are often too time expensive to be directly used to
perform uncertainty propagation studies, global sensitivity analysis or to
solve optimization problems. A well known and widely used method to circumvent
this inconvenience consists in replacing the complex computer code by a reduced
model, called a metamodel, or a response surface that represents the computer
code and requires acceptable calculation time. One particular class of
metamodels is studied: the Gaussian process model that is characterized by its
mean and covariance functions. A specific estimation procedure is developed to
adjust a Gaussian process model in complex cases (non linear relations, highly
dispersed or discontinuous output, high dimensional input, inadequate sampling
designs, ...). The efficiency of this algorithm is compared to the efficiency
of other existing algorithms on an analytical test case. The proposed
methodology is also illustrated for the case of a complex hydrogeological
computer code, simulating radionuclide transport in groundwater.
