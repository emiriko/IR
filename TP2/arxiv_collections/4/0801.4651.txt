The status of the precision tests of the electroweak interactions is reviewed
in this paper. An emphasis is put on the Standard Model analysis based on
measurements at LEP/SLC and the Tevatron. The results of the measurements of
the electroweak mixing angle in the NuTeV experiment and the future prospects
are discussed.
