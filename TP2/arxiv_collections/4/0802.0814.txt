This paper gives an exposition of relative weight filtrations on completions
of mapping class groups associated to a stable degeneration of marked genus g
curves. These relative weight filtrations have been constructed using Galois
theory (with Matsumoto) and Hodge theory (with Pearlstein and Terasoma). It is
shown that the level 0 part of the relative weight filtration is an analogue of
a parabolic subalgebra of a Kac-Moody Lie algebra. It is shown that all such
subalgebras correspond to equivalence classes of pants decompositions of the
surface -- two being equivalent if and only if they determine the same
handlebody that the reference surface bounds. One application is to show that
handlebody subgroups of mapping class groups contain elements arbitrarily far
down the lower central series of Torelli groups. (This result was also obtained
independently by Jamie Jorgensen.)
