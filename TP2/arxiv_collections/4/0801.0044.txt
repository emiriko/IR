Production of gravitational vacuum defects and their contribution to the
energy density of our Universe are discussed. These topological microstructures
(defects) could be produced in the result of creation of the Universe from
"nothing" when a gravitational vacuum condensate has appeared. They must be
isotropically distributed over the isotropic expanding Universe. After Universe
inflation these microdefects are smoothed, stretched and broken up. A part of
them could survive and now they are perceived as the structures of Lambda-term
and an unclustered dark matter. It is shown that the parametrization
noninvariance of the Wheeler-De Witt equation can be used to describe
phenomenologically vacuum topological defects of different dimensions
(worm-holes, micromembranes, microstrings and monopoles). The mathematical
illustration of these processes may be the spontaneous breaking of the local
Lorentz-invariance of the quasi-classical equations of gravity. Probably the
gravitational vacuum condensate has fixed time in our Universe. Besides,
3-dimensional topological defects renormalize Lambda-term.
