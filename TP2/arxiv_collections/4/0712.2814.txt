The injection of pure spin current into superconductors by the dynamics of a
ferromagnetic contact is studied theoretically. Taking into account suppression
of the order parameter at the interfaces (inverse proximity effect) and the
energy-dependence of spin-flip scattering, we determine the
temperature-dependent ferromagnetic resonance linewidth broadening. Our results
agree with recent experiments in Nb|permalloy bilayers [C. Bell et al.,
arXiv:cond-mat/0702461].
