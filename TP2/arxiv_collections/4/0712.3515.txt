Classes of $G$-Hom-associative algebras are constructed as deformations of
$G$-associative algebras along algebra endomorphisms. As special cases, we
obtain Hom-associative and Hom-Lie algebras as deformations of associative and
Lie algebras, respectively, along algebra endomorphisms. Chevalley-Eilenberg
type homology for Hom-Lie algebras are also constructed.
