In this article we review the present understanding of azimuthal and single
spin asymmetries for inclusive and semi-inclusive particle production in
unpolarized and polarized hadronic collisions at high energy and moderately
large transverse momentum. After summarizing the experimental information
available, we discuss and compare the main theoretical approaches formulated in
the framework of perturbative QCD. We then present in some detail a
generalization of the parton model with inclusion of spin and intrinsic
transverse momentum effects. In this context, we extensively discuss the
phenomenology of azimuthal and single spin asymmetries for several processes in
different kinematical configurations. A comparison with the predictions of
other approaches, when available, is also given. We finally emphasize some
relevant open points and challenges for future theoretical and experimental
investigation.
