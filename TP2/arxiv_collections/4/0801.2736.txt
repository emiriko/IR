We report all-electron variational and diffusion quantum Monte Carlo (VMC and
DMC) calculations for the noble gas atoms He, Ne, Ar, Kr, and Xe. The
calculations were performed using Slater-Jastrow wave functions with
Hartree-Fock single-particle orbitals. The quality of both the optimized
Jastrow factors and the nodal surfaces of the wave functions declines with
increasing atomic number Z, but the DMC calculations are tractable and well
behaved in all cases. We discuss the scaling of the computational cost of DMC
calculations with Z.
