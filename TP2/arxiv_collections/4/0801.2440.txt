In this paper, we investigate the propagation of a weak optical probe pulse
in an f-deformed Bose- Einstein condensate (BEC) of a gas with the -type three-
level atoms in the electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) regime. We
use an f- deformed generalization of an effective two- level quantum model of
the three- level configuration in which the Gardiner phonon operators for BEC
are deformed by an operator- valued function, f(n), of the particle- number
operator n. With making use of the quantum approach of the angular momentum
theory we obtain the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the system up to first
order approximation. We consider the collisions between the atoms as a special
kind of f- deformation. The collision rate k is regarded as the deformation
parameter and light propagation in the deformed BEC is analyzed. In particular,
we show that the absorptive and dispersive properties of the deformed
condensate can be controlled effectively by changing the deformation parameter
k and the total number of atoms. We find that by increasing the value of k the
group velocity of the probe pulse changes, through deformed condensate, from
subluminal to superluminal.
