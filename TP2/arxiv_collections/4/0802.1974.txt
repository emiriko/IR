We propose canonical and Lie-algebraic twist deformations of
$\kappa$-deformed Poincare Hopf algebra which leads to the generalized
$\kappa$-Minkowski space-time relations. The corresponding deformed
$\kappa$-Poincare quantum groups are also calculated. Finally, we perform the
nonrelativistic contraction limit to the corresponding twisted Galilean
algebras and dual Galilean quantum groups.
