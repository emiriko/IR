We examine the renormalization of Lee-Wick gauge theory to one loop order. We
show that only knowledge of the wavefunction renormalization is necessary to
determine the running couplings, anomalous dimensions, and vector boson masses.
In particular, the logarithmic running of the Lee-Wick vector boson mass is
exactly related to the running of the coupling. In the case of an
asymptotically free theory, the vector boson mass runs to infinity in the
ultraviolet. Thus, the UV fixed point of the pure gauge theory is an ordinary
quantum field theory. We find that the coupling runs more quickly in Lee-Wick
gauge theory than in ordinary gauge theory, so the Lee-Wick standard model does
not naturally unify at any scale. Finally, we present results on the beta
function of more general theories containing dimension six operators which
differ from previous results in the literature.
