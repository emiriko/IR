New approach to the problem of multichannel continuum spectrum of
three-cluster systems composed of an s-cluster and two neutrons is suggested
based on the discrete representation of a complete basis of allowed states of
the multiparticle harmonic oscillator. The structure of the eigenfunctions and
behavior of the eigenvalues of the three-cluster norm kernel are analyzed.
Classification of the eigenvalues of the three-cluster systems with the help of
eigenvalues of the two-body subsystem is suggested. Asymptotic boundary
conditions for a three-cluster wave function in the continuum consistent with
the requirements of the Pauli principle are established. Such asymptotic
behavior corresponds rather to subsequent decay of the three-cluster system
than to the so-called "democratic decay" associated with the hyperspherical
harmonics. The 3H+n+n configuration of the 5H nucleus is considered in detail.
