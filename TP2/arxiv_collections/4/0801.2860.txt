Topological quantum computation with Fibonacci anyons relies on the
possibility of efficiently generating unitary transformations upon
pseudoparticles braiding. The crucial fact that such set of braids has a dense
image in the unitary operations space is well known; in addition, the
Solovay-Kitaev algorithm allows to approach a given unitary operation to any
desired accuracy. In this paper, the latter task is fulfilled with an
alternative method, in the SU(2) case, based on a generalization of the
geodesic dome construction to higher dimension.
