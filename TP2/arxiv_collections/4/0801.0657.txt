We consider a one parameter family of mass terms for the Skyrme model that
disfavours shell-like configurations for multi-baryon classical solutions. We
argue that a model with such mass terms can provide a better description of
nuclei as shell like configurations are now less stable than in the traditional
massive Skyrme model
