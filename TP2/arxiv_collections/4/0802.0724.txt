We present the recent developments in exact amplitude-based resummation
methods for non-Abelian gauge theories as they relate to precision LHC physics.
We discuss QEDXQCD exponentiation, shower/ME matching, IR-improved DGLAP-CS
theory and implications, as developed by one of us (BFLW), for a UV finite
theory of quantum general relativity.
