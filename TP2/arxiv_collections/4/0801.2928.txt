The dynamics of ultracold neutral atoms subject to a non-Abelian gauge field
is investigated. In particular we analyze in detail a simple experimental
scheme to achieve a constant, but non-Abelian gauge field, and discuss in the
frame of this gauge field the non-Abelian Aharanov-Bohm effect. In the last
part of this paper, we discuss intrinsic non-Abelian effects in the dynamics of
cold atomic wavepackets.
