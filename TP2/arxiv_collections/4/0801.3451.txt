\large{\bf Abstract-} Unsteady Hall Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) near a
hyperbolic magnetic neutral line is investigated. An exact analytical solution
describing a self-similar evolution is given. This solution shows a negligible
impact on the current-sheet formation process near the hyperbolic magnetic
neutral line at small times by the Hall effect but, subsequently, a quenching
by the Hall effect of the finite-time singularity exhibited in ideal MHD and,
hence a prevention of the current density blow-up at large times. The
asymptotic result given by this time-dependent solution is in full quantitative
agreement with the formulation of \textit{steady} Hall MHD near a $X$-type
magnetic neutral line (Shivamoggi [23]). The latter formulation showed that
this asymptotic result indeed corresponds to a hyperbolic configuration of the
magnetic field lines in the \textit{steady} case.
