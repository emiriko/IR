We investigate the crossed Andreev reflections between two graphene leads
connected by a narrow superconductor. When the leads are respectively of the
n-and p- type, we find that electron elastic cotunneling and local Andreev
reflection are both eliminated even in the absence of any valley-isospin or
spin polarizations. We further predict oscillations of both diagonal and cross
conductances as a function of the distance between the graphene-superconductor
interfaces.
