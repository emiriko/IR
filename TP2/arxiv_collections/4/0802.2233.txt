The waiting time distribution $w(\tau)$, i.e. the probability for a delay
$\tau$ between two subsequent transition (`jumps') of particles, is a
statistical tool in (quantum) transport. Using generalized Master equations for
systems coupled to external particle reservoirs, one can establish relations
between $w(\tau)$ and other statistical transport quantities such as the noise
spectrum and the Full Counting Statistics. It turns out that $w(\tau)$ usually
contains additional information on system parameters and properties such as
quantum coherence, the number of internal states, or the entropy of the current
channels that participate in transport.
