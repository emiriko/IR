To study subregions of a turbulence velocity field, a long record of velocity
data of grid turbulence is divided into smaller segments. For each segment, we
calculate statistics such as the mean rate of energy dissipation and the mean
energy at each scale. Their values significantly fluctuate, in lognormal
distributions at least as a good approximation. Each segment is not under
equilibrium between the mean rate of energy dissipation and the mean rate of
energy transfer that determines the mean energy. These two rates still
correlate among segments when their length exceeds the correlation length. Also
between the mean rate of energy dissipation and the mean total energy, there is
a correlation characterized by the Reynolds number for the whole record,
implying that the large-scale flow affects each of the segments.
