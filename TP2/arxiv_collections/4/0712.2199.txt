The interaction of compact objects with an infinitely extended mirror plane
due to quantum fluctuations of a scalar or electromagnetic field that scatters
off the objects is studied. The mirror plane is assumed to obey either
Dirichlet or Neumann boundary conditions or to be perfectly reflecting. Using
the method of images, we generalize a recently developed approach for compact
objects in unbounded space [1,2] to show that the Casimir interaction between
the objects and the mirror plane can be accurately obtained over a wide range
of separations in terms of charge and current fluctuations of the objects and
their images. Our general result for the interaction depends only on the
scattering matrices of the compact objects. It applies to scalar fields with
arbitrary boundary conditions and to the electromagnetic field coupled to
dielectric objects. For the experimentally important electromagnetic Casimir
interaction between a perfectly conducting sphere and a plane mirror we present
the first results that apply at all separations. We obtain both an asymptotic
large distance expansion and the two lowest order correction terms to the
proximity force approximation. The asymptotic Casimir-Polder potential for an
atom and a mirror is generalized to describe the interaction between a
dielectric sphere and a mirror, involving higher order multipole
polarizabilities that are important at sub-asymptotic distances.
