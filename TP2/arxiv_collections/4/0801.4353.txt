The description of realistic strongly correlated systems has recently
advanced through the combination of density functional theory in the local
density approximation (LDA) and dynamical mean field theory (DMFT). This
LDA+DMFT method is able to treat both strongly correlated insulators and
metals. Several interfaces between LDA and DMFT have been used, such as (N-th
order) Linear Muffin Tin Orbitals or Maximally localized Wannier Functions.
Such schemes are however either complex in use or additional simplifications
are often performed (i.e., the atomic sphere approximation). We present an
alternative implementation of LDA+DMFT, which keeps the precision of the
Wannier implementation, but which is lighter. It relies on the projection of
localized orbitals onto a restricted set of Kohn-Sham states to define the
correlated subspace. The method is implemented within the Projector Augmented
Wave (PAW) and within the Mixed Basis Pseudopotential (MBPP) frameworks. This
opens the way to electronic structure calculations within LDA+DMFT for more
complex structures with the precision of an all-electron method. We present an
application to two correlated systems, namely SrVO3 and beta-NiS (a
charge-transfer material), including ligand states in the basis-set. The
results are compared to calculations done with Maximally Localized Wannier
functions, and the physical features appearing in the orbitally resolved
spectral functions are discussed.
