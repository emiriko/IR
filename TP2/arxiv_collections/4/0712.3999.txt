Recently the explicit applicability of bound entanglement in quantum
cryptography has been shown. In this paper some of recent results respecting
this topic are reviewed. In particular relevant notions and definitions are
reminded. The new construction of bound entangled states containing secure
correlations is presented. It provides low dimensional 6\otimes6 bound
entangled states with nonzero distillable key.
