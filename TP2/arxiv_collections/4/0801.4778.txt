We derive and discuss expressions for the temperature-dependent electrostatic
polarizabilities of off-center ions holding good under various experimental
conditions. At low temperatures and electric-field strengths, all of them
reasonably reduce to values characteristic of phonon-coupled two-level systems.
Prospects for further studies of the dispersive coupling are also considered.
