The ballistic performance of electron transport in nanowire transistors is
examined using a 10 orbital sp3d5s* atomistic tight-binding model for the
description of the electronic structure, and the top-of-the-barrier
semiclassical ballistic model for calculation of the transport properties of
the transistors. The dispersion is self consistently computed with a 2D Poisson
solution for the electrostatic potential in the cross section of the wire. The
effective mass of the nanowire changes significantly from the bulk value under
strong quantization, and effects such as valley splitting strongly lift the
degeneracies of the valleys. These effects are pronounced even further under
filling of the lattice with charge. The effective mass approximation is in good
agreement with the tight binding model in terms of current-voltage
characteristics only in certain cases. In general, for small diameter wires,
the effective mass approximation fails.
