Using the general factorization approach, we present a detailed investigation
for the branching ratios, CP asymmetries and longitudinal polarization
fractions in all charmless hadronic $B \to VV$ decays (except for the pure
annihilation processes) within the most general two-Higgs-doublet model with
spontaneous CP violation. It is seen that such a new physics model only has
very small contributions to the branching ratios and longitudinal polarization
fractions. However, as the model has rich CP-violating sources, it can lead to
significant effects on the CP asymmetries, especially on those of
penguin-dominated decay modes, which provides good signals for probing new
physics beyond the SM in the future B-physics experiments.
