Exact (to all orders in Knudsen number) equations of linear hydrodynamics are
derived from the Boltzmann kinetic equation with the Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook
collision integral. The exact hydrodynamic equations are cast in a form which
allows us to immediately prove their hyperbolicity, stability, and existence of
an H-theorem.
