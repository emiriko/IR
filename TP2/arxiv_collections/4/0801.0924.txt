A new strategy of fitting the coupling constants of the nuclear energy
density functional is proposed, which shifts attention from ground-state bulk
to single-particle properties. The latter are analyzed in terms of the bare
single-particle energies and mass, shape, and spin core-polarization effects.
Fit of the isoscalar spin-orbit and both isoscalar and isovector tensor
coupling constants directly to the f5/2-f7/2 spin-orbit splittings in 40Ca,
56Ni, and 48Ca is proposed as a practical realization of this new programme. It
is shown that this fit requires drastic changes in the isoscalar spin-orbit
strength and the tensor coupling constants as compared to the commonly accepted
values but it considerably and systematically improves basic single-particle
properties including spin-orbit splittings and magic-gap energies. Impact of
these changes on nuclear binding energies is also discussed.
