We show that scalable multipartite entanglement among light fields may be
generated by optical parametric oscillators (OPO). The tripartite entanglement
existent among the three bright beams produced by a single OPO -- pump, signal,
and idler -- is scalable to a system of many OPOs by pumping them in cascade
with the same optical field. This latter serves as an entanglement distributor.
The special case of two OPOs is studied, as it is shown that the resulting five
bright beams share genuine multipartite entanglement. In addition, the
structure of entanglement distribution among the fields can be manipulated to
some degree by tuning the incident pump power. The scalability to many fields
is straightforward, allowing an alternative implementation of a multipartite
quantum information network with continuous variables.
