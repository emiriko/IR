We describe the rank 3 Temperley-Lieb-Martin algebras in terms of Kuperberg's
A_2-webs. We define consistent labelings of webs, and use them to describe the
coefficients of decompositions into irreducible webs. We introduce web
immanants, inspired by Temperley-Lieb immanants of Rhoades and Skandera. We
show that web immanants are positive when evaluated on totally positive
matrices, and describe some further properties.
