We show how to explicitly construct an $O(nd)$ size and constant quantum
depth circuit which encodes any given $n$-qubit stabilizer code with $d$
generators. Our construction is derived using the graphic description for
stabilizer codes and the one-way quantum computation model. Our result
demonstrates how to use cluster states as scalable resources for many
multi-qubit entangled states and how to use the one-way quantum computation
model to improve design of quantum algorithms.
