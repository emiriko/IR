Entanglement is closely related to some fundamental features of the dynamics
of composite quantum systems: quantum entanglement enhances the "speed" of
evolution of certain quantum states, as measured by the time required to reach
an orthogonal state. The concept of "speed" of quantum evolution constitutes an
important ingredient in any attempt to determine the fundamental limits that
basic physical laws impose on how fast a physical system can process or
transmit information. Here we explore the relationship between entanglement and
the speed of quantum evolution in the context of the quantum brachistochrone
problem. Given an initial and a final state of a composite system we consider
the amount of entanglement associated with the brachistochrone evolution
between those states, showing that entanglement is an essential resource to
achieve the alluded time-optimal quantum evolution.
