The littlest Higgs model with T-parity, which is called $LHT$ model, predicts
the existence of the new particles, such as heavy top quark, heavy gauge
bosons, and mirror fermions. We calculate the one-loop contributions of these
new particles to the top quark chromomagnetic dipole moment $(CMDM)$ $\Delta
K$. We find that the contribution of the $LHT$ model is one order of magnitude
smaller than the standard model prediction value.
