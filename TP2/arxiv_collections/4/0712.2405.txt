Specific binding of proteins to DNA is one of the most common ways in which
gene expression is controlled. Although general rules for the DNA-protein
recognition can be derived, the ambiguous and complex nature of this mechanism
precludes a simple recognition code, therefore the prediction of DNA target
sequences is not straightforward. DNA-protein interactions can be studied using
computational methods which can complement the current experimental methods and
offer some advantages. In the present work we use physical effective potentials
to evaluate the DNA-protein binding affinities for the lambda repressor-DNA
complex for which structural and thermodynamic experimental data are available.
The effect of conformational sampling by Molecular Dynamics simulations on the
computed binding energy is assessed; results show that this effect is in
general negative and the reproducibility of the experimental values decreases
with the increase of simulation time considered. The free energy of binding for
non-specific complexes agrees with earlier theoretical suggestions. Moreover,
as a results of these analyses, we propose a protocol for the prediction of
DNA-binding target sequences. The possibility of searching regulatory elements
within the bacteriophage-lambda genome using this protocol is explored. Our
analysis shows good prediction capabilities, even in the absence of any
thermodynamic data and information on the naturally recognized sequence. This
study supports the conclusion that physics-based methods can offer a completely
complementary methodology to sequence-based methods for the identification of
DNA-binding protein target sequences.
