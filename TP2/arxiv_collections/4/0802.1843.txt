Plastic deformation of micron and sub-micron scale specimens is characterized
by intermittent sequences of large strain bursts (dislocation avalanches) which
are separated by regions of near-elastic loading. In the present investigation
we perform a statistical characterization of strain bursts observed in
stress-controlled compressive deformation of monocrystalline Molybdenum
micropillars. We characterize the bursts in terms of the associated elongation
increments and peak deformation rates, and demonstrate that these quantities
follow power-law distributions that do not depend on specimen orientation or
stress rate. We also investigate the statistics of stress increments in between
the bursts, which are found to be Weibull distributed and exhibit a
characteristic size effect. We discuss our findings in view of observations of
deformation bursts in other materials, such as face-centered cubic and
hexagonal metals.
