In this paper, we investigate the emergence of a predator-prey system with
Ivlev-type functional response and reaction-diffusion. We study how diffusion
affects the stability of predator-prey coexistence equilibrium and derive the
conditions for Hopf and Turing bifurcation in the spatial domain. Based on the
bifurcation analysis, we give the spatial pattern formation, the evolution
process of the system near the coexistence equilibrium point, via numerical
simulation. We find that pure Hopf instability leads to the formation of spiral
patterns and pure Turing instability destroys the spiral pattern and leads to
the formation of chaotic spatial pattern. Furthermore, we perform three
categories of initial perturbations which predators are introduced in a small
domain to the coexistence equilibrium point to illustrate the emergence of
spatiotemporal patterns, we also find that in the beginning of evolution of the
spatial pattern, the special initial conditions have an effect on the formation
of spatial patterns, though the effect is less and less with the more and more
iterations. This indicates that for prey-dependent type predator-prey model,
pattern formations do depend on the initial conditions, while for
predator-dependent type they do not. Our results show that modeling by
reaction-diffusion equations is an appropriate tool for investigating
fundamental mechanisms of complex spatiotemporal dynamics.
