In a recent paper, the generalization of the Jensen Shannon divergence (JSD)
in the context of quantum theory has been studied (Phys. Rev. A 72, 052310
(2005)). This distance between quantum states has shown to verify several of
the properties required for a good distinguishability measure. Here we
investigate the metric character of this distance. More precisely we show,
formally for pure states and by means of simulations for mixed states, that its
square root verifies the triangle inequality.
