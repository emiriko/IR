Universal properties of the Coulomb interaction energy apply to all
many-electron systems. Bounds on the exchange-correlation energy, inparticular,
are important for the construction of improved density functionals. Here we
investigate one such universal property -- the Lieb-Oxford lower bound -- for
ionic and molecular systems. In recent work [J. Chem. Phys. 127, 054106
(2007)], we observed that for atoms and electron liquids this bound may be
substantially tightened. Calculations for a few ions and molecules suggested
the same tendency, but were not conclusive due to the small number of systems
considered. Here we extend that analysis to many different families of ions and
molecules, and find that for these, too, the bound can be empirically tightened
by a similar margin as for atoms and electron liquids. Tightening the
Lieb-Oxford bound will have consequences for the performance of various
approximate exchange-correlation functionals.
