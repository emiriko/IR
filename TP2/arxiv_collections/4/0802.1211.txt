We introduce a class of variational states to describe quantum many-body
systems. This class generalizes matrix product states which underly the
density-matrix renormalization group approach by combining them with weighted
graph states. States within this class may (i) possess arbitrarily long-ranged
two-point correlations, (ii) exhibit an arbitrary degree of block entanglement
entropy up to a volume law, (iii) may be taken translationally invariant, while
at the same time (iv) local properties and two-point correlations can be
computed efficiently. This new variational class of states can be thought of as
being prepared from matrix product states, followed by commuting unitaries on
arbitrary constituents, hence truly generalizing both matrix product and
weighted graph states. We use this class of states to formulate a
renormalization algorithm with graph enhancement (RAGE) and present numerical
examples demonstrating that improvements over density-matrix renormalization
group simulations can be achieved in the simulation of ground states and
quantum algorithms. Further generalizations, e.g., to higher spatial
dimensions, are outlined.
