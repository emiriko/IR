From the response to external stimuli to cell division and death, the
dynamics of living cells is based on the expression of specific genes at
specific times. The decision when to express a gene is implemented by the
binding and unbinding of transcription factor molecules to regulatory DNA.
Here, we construct stochastic models of gene expression dynamics and test them
on experimental time-series data of messenger-RNA concentrations. The models
are used to infer biophysical parameters of gene transcription, including the
statistics of transcription factor-DNA binding and the target genes controlled
by a given transcription factor.
