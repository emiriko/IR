The possibility of quantum oscillations of the tunnel conductance and
magnetoresistance induced by spin-wave excitations in a
ferromagnet-ferromagnet-ferromagnet double barrier tunnel junction, when the
magnetizations of the two side ferromagnets are aligned antiparallel to that of
the middle ferromagnet, is investigated in a self-consistent manner by means of
Keldysh nonequilibrium Green function method. It has been found that owing to
the s-d exchange interactions between conduction electrons and the spin density
induced by spin accumulation in the middle ferromagnet, the differential
conductance and the TMR indeed oscillate with the increase of bias voltage,
being consistent with the phenomenon that is observed recently in experiments.
The effects of magnon modes, the energy levels of electrons as well as the
molecular field in the central ferromagnet on the oscillatory transport
property of the system are also discussed.
