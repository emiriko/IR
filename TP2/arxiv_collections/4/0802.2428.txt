In this project, we have developed a sign language tutor that lets users
learn isolated signs by watching recorded videos and by trying the same signs.
The system records the user's video and analyses it. If the sign is recognized,
both verbal and animated feedback is given to the user. The system is able to
recognize complex signs that involve both hand gestures and head movements and
expressions. Our performance tests yield a 99% recognition rate on signs
involving only manual gestures and 85% recognition rate on signs that involve
both manual and non manual components, such as head movement and facial
expressions.
