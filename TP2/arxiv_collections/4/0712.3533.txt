A number of hard exclusive scattering processes can be described in terms of
generalized parton distributions (GPDs) and perturbative hard-scattering
kernels. Both the physical amplitude and the hard-scattering kernels fulfill
dispersion relations. We show that their consistency at all orders in
perturbation theory is guaranteed if the GPDs satisfy certain integral
relations. These relations are fulfilled thanks to Lorentz invariance.
