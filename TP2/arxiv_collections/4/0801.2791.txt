We propose and investigate a technique for generating smooth two-dimensional
potentials for ultra-cold atoms based on the rapid scanning of a far-detuned
laser beam using a two-dimensional acousto-optical modulator (AOM). We
demonstrate the implementation of a feed-forward mechanism for fast and
accurate control of the spatial intensity of the laser beam, resulting in
improved homogeneity for the atom trap. This technique could be used to
generate a smooth toroidal trap that would be useful for static and dynamic
experiments on superfluidity and persistent currents with ultra-cold atoms.
