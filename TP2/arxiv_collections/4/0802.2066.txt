While Einstein clocks synchronization process is performed, one has a well
defined region in which the clocks are synchronized and another one in which
the clocks are not yet synchronized. The frontier between them evolves
differently from the perspective of observers in relative motion. A discussion
is conducted upon direct observation of the phenomenon and Minkowski diagrams.
