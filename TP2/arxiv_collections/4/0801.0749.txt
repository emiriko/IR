We discuss propagation effects in realistic, transparent, metallo-dielectric
photonic band gap structures in the context of negative refraction and
super-resolution in the visible and near infrared ranges. In the resonance
tunneling regime, we find that for transverse-magnetic incident polarization,
field localization effects contribute to a waveguiding phenomenon that makes it
possible for the light to remain confined within a small fraction of a
wavelength, without any transverse boundaries, due to the suppression of
diffraction. This effect is related to negative refraction of the Poynting
vector inside each metal layer, balanced by normal refraction inside the
adjacent dielectric layer: The degree of field localization and material
dispersion together determine the total momentum that resides within any given
layer, and thus the direction of energy flow. We find that the transport of
evanescent wave vectors is mediated by the excitation of quasi-stationary, low
group velocity surface waves responsible for relatively large losses. As
representative examples we consider transparent metallo-dielectric stacks such
as Ag/TiO2 and Ag/GaP and show in detail how to obtain the optimum conditions
for high transmittance of both propagating and evanescent modes for
super-guiding and super resolution applications across the visible and near IR
ranges. Finally, we study the influence of gain on super-resolution. We find
that the introduction of gain can compensate the losses caused by the
excitation of surface plasmons, improves the resolving characteristics of the
lens, and leads to gain-tunable super-resolution.
