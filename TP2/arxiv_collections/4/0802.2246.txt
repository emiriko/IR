The energy loss due to a quadratic velocity dependent force on a quantum
particle bouncing on a perfectly reflecting surface is obtained for a full
cycle of motion. We approach this problem by means of a new effective
phenomenological Hamiltonian which corresponds to the actual energy of the
system and obtained the correction to the eigenvalues of the energy in first
order quantum perturbation theory for the case of weak dissipation.
