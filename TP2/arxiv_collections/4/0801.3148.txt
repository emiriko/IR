The dissipation properties of a fine sand system are investigated by a
low-frequency mechanical spectroscopy. The experiments show many interesting
profiles of the relative energy dissipation, which imply that some structural
transition of force chains in dense granular media has occurred. The following
data and discussion indicate that the transition of force chains will lead to
the small deformation of arrangement in the granular system, which is
responsible for the historical effects. We hope this research can improve our
knowledge of the microstructure of the granular materials.
