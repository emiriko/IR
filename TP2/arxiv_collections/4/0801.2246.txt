We propose making light emitting diodes out of inverse spin valves. The
proposed diodes rely on the spin-dependent electron transport of inverse spin
valves that are layered structures of a ferromagnetic half-metal sandwiched
between two non-magnetic metals. Under a bias, a giant spin-dependent chemical
potential difference between spin-up and spin-down electrons is created. Thus,
the inverse spin valves are possible to emit light when electrons in higher
chemical potential go to the lower chemical potential. The advantages of this
type of light emitting diodes include tunableness and less demand on materials.
