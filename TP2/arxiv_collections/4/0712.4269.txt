We find a dual gravity theory to pure confining N=1 supersymmetric SU(N)
gauge theory in four dimensions which has the correct gauge coupling running in
addition to reproducing the appropriate pattern of chiral symmetry breaking. It
is constructed in type IIB string theory on R^{1,3} X R^1 X S^2 X S^3
background with N number of electric D5 and 2N number of magnetic D7-branes
filling four dimensional spacetime and wrapping respectively two and four
cycles.
