Three-body interactions have been measured among three charged colloidal
particles in deionized solvent. Two of the particles have been confined to an
optical line-trap while the third one was approached by means of a focused
laser beam. The experimentally determined three-body interactions are
attractive and roughly of the same magnitude and range as the
pair-interactions. In addition, numerical calculations have been performed,
which show good agreement with the experimental results.
