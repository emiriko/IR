This paper describes how it is possible to increase GP Computing Power via
Volunteer Computing (VC) using the BOINC framework. Two experiments using
well-known GP tools -Lil-gp & ECJ- are performed in order to demonstrate the
benefit of using VC in terms of computing power and speed up. Finally we
present an extension of the model where any GP tool or framework can be used
inside BOINC regardless of its programming language, complexity or required
operating system.
