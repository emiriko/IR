A surface distribution of the electroluminescence intensity of silicon p-n
light emitting diodes is obtained under space scanning experiments at room
temperature. An emitting surface of the diodes, represented by a few small
bright emitting dots and a weakly emitting area outside the dots, serves as a
direct evidence of the self-compression of injected electron-hole plasma in
silicon. The plasma self-compression explains concentration of injected
carriers into one or a few strongly emitting plasma drops.
