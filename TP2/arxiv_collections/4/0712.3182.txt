Universal set of quantum gates are realized from the conduction-band electron
spin qubits of quantum dots embedded in a microcavity via two-channel Raman
interaction. All of the gate operations are independent of the cavity mode
states, \emph{i.e.}, insensitive to the thermal cavity field. Individual
addressing and effective switch of the cavity mediated interaction are directly
possible here. Meanwhile, gate operations also can be carried out in parallel.
The simple realization of needed interaction for selective qubits makes current
scenario more suitable for scalable quantum computation.
