Monotheistic religions such as Judaism and Christianity affirm that God loves
all humans and created them in His image. However, we have learned from Darwin
that we were not created separately from other life on earth. Some Christians
opposed Darwinian evolution because it undercut certain design arguments for
the existence of God. Today there is the growing idea that the fine-tuned
constants of physics might be explained by a multiverse with very many
different sets of constants of physics. Some Christians oppose the multiverse
for similarly undercutting other design arguments for the existence of God.
However, undercutting one argument does not disprove its conclusion. Here I
argue that multiverse ideas, though not automatically a solution to the
problems of physics, deserve serious consideration and are not in conflict with
Christian theology as I see it.
  Although this paper as a whole is {\it addressed} primarily to Christians in
cosmology and others interested in the relation between the multiverse and
theism, it should be of {\it interest} to a wider audience. Proper subsets of
this paper are addressed to other Christians, to other theists, to other
cosmologists, to other scientists, and to others interested in the multiverse
and theism.
