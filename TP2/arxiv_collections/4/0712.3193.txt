We discuss exclusive vector meson electroproduction within the QCD collinear
factorization framework. In Bjorken kinematics the amplitude factorizes in a
convolution of the nonperturbative meson distribution amplitude and the
generalized parton densities with the perturbatively calculable hard-scattering
amplitudes, which are presently known to next-to-leading order (NLO). At small
$x_{\rm B}$ NLO corrections are very large. It is related to appearance of BFKL
type logarithms in the hard-scattering amplitudes, that calls for a resummation
of these effects at higher orders. Here we report the first results of such
resummation.
