We study two-flavor collective neutrino oscillations in the dense-neutrino
region above the neutrino sphere in a supernova (SN). The angular dependence of
the neutrino-neutrino interaction potential causes "multi-angle" effects that
can lead either to complete kinematical decoherence in flavor space or only to
small differences between different trajectories. This nonlinear system
switches abruptly between "self-maintained coherence" and "self-induced
decoherence" among the angular modes, depending on the strength of the
deleptonization flux. For a realistic SN the quasi single-angle behavior is
probably typical, simplifying the numerical treatment and probably allowing for
the survival of observational features of flavor oscillations.
