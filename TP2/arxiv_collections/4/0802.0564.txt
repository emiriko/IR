The speed of quantum computation is investigated through the time evolution
of the speed of the orthogonality. The external field components for classical
treatment beside the detuning and the coupling parameters for quantum treatment
play important roles on the computational speed. It has been shown that the
number of photons has no significant effect on the speed of computation.
However, it is very sensitive to the variation in both detuning and the
interaction coupling parameters.
