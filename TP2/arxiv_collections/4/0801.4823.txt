Angular-momentum-projected energy surface calculations for A~110 nuclei
indicate three distinct energy minima occurring at different angular-momenta.
These correspond to normal, super-, and hyper-deformed shapes coexisting in one
nucleus. 110Pd is studied in detail, with a quantitative prediction on super-
and hyper-deformed spectra by the Projected Shell Model calculation. It is
suggested that several other neighboring nuclei in the A-110 mass region, with
the neutron number around 64, also exhibit clear super- and hyper-deformation
minima.
