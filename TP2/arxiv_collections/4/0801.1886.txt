Kicked double-well system is investigated both analytically and numerically.
Phenomenological formula for ground quasienergy splitting is obtained using
resonances overlap criterion in the framework of chaotic instanton approach.
Results of numerical calculations of quasienergy spectrum are in good agreement
with the phenomenological formula.
