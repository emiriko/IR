We show that high-order harmonics generated from molecules by intense laser
pulses can be expressed as the product of a returning electron wave packet and
the photo-recombination cross section (PRCS) where the electron wave packet can
be obtained from simple strong-field approximation (SFA) or from a companion
atomic target. Using these wave packets but replacing the PRCS obtained from
SFA or from the atomic target by the accurate PRCS from molecules, the
resulting HHG spectra are shown to agree well with the benchmark results from
direct numerical solution of the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation, for the
case of H$_2^+$ in laser fields. The result illustrates that these powerful
theoretical tools can be used for obtaining high-order harmonic spectra from
molecules. More importantly, the results imply that the PRCS extracted from
laser-induced HHG spectra can be used for time-resolved dynamic chemical
imaging of transient molecules with temporal resolutions down to a few
femtoseconds.
