We determine under what conditions Scalar Tensor cosmologies predict an
expansion rate which is reduced as compared to the standard General Relativity
case. We show that ST theories with a single matter sector typically predict an
enchanced Hubble rate in the past, as a consequence of the requirement of an
attractive fixed point towards General Relativity at late times. Instead, when
additional matter sectors with different conformal factors are added, the late
time convergence to General Relativity is mantained and at the same time a
reduced expansion rate in the past can be driven. For suitable choices of the
parameters which govern the scalar field evolution, a sizeable reduction (up to
about 2 orders of magnitude) of the Hubble rate prior to Big Bang
Nucleosynthesis can be obtained. We then discuss the impact of these
cosmological models on the relic abundance of dark matter is minimal
Supergravity models: we show that the cosmologically allowed regions in
parameter space are significantly enlarged, implying a change in the potential
reach of LHC on the neutralino phenomenology.
