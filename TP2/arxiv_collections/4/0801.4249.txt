These notes are a short introduction to the pinch technique. We present the
one-loop calculations for basic QCD Green's functions. The equivalence between
the pinch technique and the background field method is explicitly shown at the
one-loop level. We review the absorptive pinch technique in the last sections.
These lectures are a compilation of relevant papers on this subject and are
prepared for the third Modave Summer School in Mathematical Physics.
