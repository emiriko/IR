Unexpected relations between fidelity decay and cross form--factor, i.e.,
parametric level correlations in the time domain are found both by a heuristic
argument and by comparing exact results, using supersymmetry techniques, in the
framework of random matrix theory. A power law decay near Heisenberg time, as a
function of the relevant parameter, is shown to be at the root of revivals
recently discovered for fidelity decay. For cross form--factors the revivals
are illustrated by a numerical study of a multiply kicked Ising spin chain.
