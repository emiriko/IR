We investigate the temperature and doping dependence of the optical
conductivity $\sigma(\omega)$ of Nd$_{2-x}$Ce$_x$CuO$_4$ in terms of
magnetic/lattice polaron formation. We employ dynamical mean-field theory in
the context of the Holstein-t-J model where an exact analytical solution is
available in the limit of infinite connectivity. We show that the pseudogap
features in the optical conductivity of this compound can be associated to the
formation of lattice polarons assisted by the magnetic interaction.
