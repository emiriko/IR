We study the supremum of some random Dirichlet polynomials with independent
coefficients and obtain sharp upper and lower bounds for supremum expectation
thus extending the results from our previous work (see
http://arXiv.org/abs/math/0703691). Our approach in proving these results is
entirely based on methods of stochastic processes, in particular the metric
entropy method.
