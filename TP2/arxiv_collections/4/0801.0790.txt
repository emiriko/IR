The glass transition temperature and relaxation dynamics of the segmental
motions of thin films of polystyrene labeled with a dye,
4-[N-ethyl-N-(hydroxyethyl)]amino-4-nitraozobenzene (Disperse Red 1, DR1) are
investigated using dielectric measurements. The dielectric relaxation strength
of the DR1-labeled polystyrene is approximately 65 times larger than that of
the unlabeled polystyrene above the glass transition, while there is almost no
difference between them below the glass transition. The glass transition
temperature of the DR1-labeled polystyrene can be determined as a crossover
temperature at which the temperature coefficient of the electric capacitance
changes from the value of the glassy state to that of the liquid state. The
glass transition temperature of the DR1-labeled polystyrene decreases with
decreasing film thickness in a reasonably similar manner to that of the
unlabeled polystyrene thin films. The dielectric relaxation spectrum of the
DR1-labeled polystyrene is also investigated. As thickness decreases, the
$\alpha$-relaxation time becomes smaller and the distribution of the
$\alpha$-relaxation times becomes broader. These results show that thin films
of DR1-labeled polystyrene are a suitable system for investigating confinement
effects of the glass transition dynamics using dielectric relaxation
spectroscopy.
