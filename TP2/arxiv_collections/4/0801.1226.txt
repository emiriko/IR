We introduce an extension of the character expansion method to the case of
supergroups. This method allows us to calculate a superversion of the
Leutwyler-Smilga integral which, to the best of our knowledge, has not been
calculated before. We also use the method to generalize a previously calculated
superversion of the Berezin-Karpelevich integral. Our character expansion
method should also allow for the calculation of other supergroup integrals.
