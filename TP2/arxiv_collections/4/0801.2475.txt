We have searched for neutrinoless $\tau$ lepton decays into $\ell$ and $V^0$,
where $\ell$ stands for an electron or muon, and $V^0$ for a vector meson
($\phi$, $\omega$, $K^{*0}$, $\bar{K}^{*0}$ or $\rho^0$), using 543 fb$^{-1}$
of data collected with the Belle detector at the KEKB asymmetric-energy
$e^+e^-$ collider. No excess of signal events over the expected background has
been observed, and we set upper limits on the branching fractions in the range
$(5.9-18) \times 10^{-8}$ at the 90% confidence level. These upper limits
include the first results for the $\ell \omega$ mode as well as new limits that
are significantly more restrictive than our previous results for the $\ell
\phi$, $\ell K^{*0}$, $\ell \bar{K}^{*0}$ and $\ell \rho^0$ modes.
