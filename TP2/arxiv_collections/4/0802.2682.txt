It is shown that the `arrow of time' operator, M_F, recently suggested by
Strauss et al., in arXiv:0802.2448v1 [quant-ph], is simply related to the sign
of the canonical `time' observable, T (apparently first introduced by Holevo).
In particular, the monotonic decrease of < M_F > corresponds to the fact that <
sgn T > increases monotonically with time. This relationship also provides a
physical interpretation of the property M_F < 1. Some further properties and
possible generalisations are pointed out, including to almost-periodic systems.
