We examine the effect of adding pion exchange between quarks and pion
self-energy corrections to the Los Alamos Relativistic Quark model with a short
distance cutoff of the Bethe form. The contributions to the nucleon and the
Delta-baryon are small. We conclude that the model is stable under this change
in the sense that significant changes to the model parameters are not required.
