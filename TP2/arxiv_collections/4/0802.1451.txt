We employ an evolutionary algorithm to investigate the optimal design of
composite protectors using one-dimensional granular chains composed of beads of
various sizes, masses, and stiffnesses. We define a fitness function using the
maximum force transmitted from the protector to a "wall" that represents the
body to be protected and accordingly optimize the {topology} (arrangement),
{size}, and {material} of the chain. We obtain optimally randomized granular
protectors characterized by high-energy equipartition and the transformation of
incident waves into interacting solitary pulses. We consistently observe that
the pulses traveling to the wall combine to form an extended (long-wavelength),
small-amplitude pulse.
