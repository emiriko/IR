We point out a generic correlation between the Friedberg-Lee symmetry of
quark mass operators and the vanishing of quark masses. We make
phenomenological explorations on two textures of quark mass matrices with the
broken Friedberg-Lee symmetry. We present a new pattern of quark mass matrices
in agreement with current experimental data. Both analytical and numerical
results of our calculations are discussed in detail.
