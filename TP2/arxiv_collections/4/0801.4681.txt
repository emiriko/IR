The collision cross section of the rotational transition J = 2 <- 1 of
3,3,3-trifluoropropyne, CF3CCH, caused by rare gas perturbers has been
determined by investigating transient emission signals of molecular gas
samples. From analysis of the pressure dependence of the width of the
rotational line J = 2<-1 pressure broadening parameters have been derived for
the pure gas and for mixtures with the rare gases He, Ne, Ar, Kr and Xe. The
pressure shift parameter for the pure gas sigmas/p = 29.03(12) kHz/Pa also has
been obtained. Calculations based on the Anderson-Tsao-Curnutte theory using
induction and dispersion interactions for the description of collisions of
CF3CCH with He, Ne, Ar, Kr and Xe, respectively, are in qualitative agreement
with the experimental results.
