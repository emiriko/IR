It is shown that by properly designing the spatial dependence of the
nonlinearity it is possible to induce long-living Bloch oscillations of a
localized wavepacket in a periodic potential. The results are supported both by
analytical and numerical investigations and are interpreted in terms of matter
wave dynamics displaying dozens of oscillation periods without any visible
distortion of the wave packet.
