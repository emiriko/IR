We assume that all quark and lepton mass matrices have upper triangular form.
Using all available experimental data on quark and lepton masses and mixing
angles we make a fit in which we determine mass matrices elements. There are
too many free parameters and our solutions are not uniqe. We look for solutions
with small non diagonal mixing matrix elements. In order to reduce the number
of free parameters we assume that the matrix element $(M)_{13}$ vanishes in
\underline{all} mass matrices. Such universal assumption was drown from
considering different numerical solutions. The lepton sector, due to large
mixing angles and very small errors for charged lepton masses, is more
restrictive then quark sector. We present the solution in this case. The
absolute values of neutrino masses are not fixed. The another possibility of
reducing number of free parameters was considered by us before. With the
additional assumption motivated by SU(5) symmetry which connects mixing in
right handed down quarks with left handed charged leptons we get a solution in
which observed Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa mixing for quarks comes mainly from
non diagonal terms in up quark mass matrix. From the fit we get also
predictions for neutrino masses.
