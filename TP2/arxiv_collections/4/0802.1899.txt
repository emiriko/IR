We study the heat transfer between two parallel metallic semi-infinite media
with a gap in the nanometer-scale range. We show that the near-field radiative
heat flux saturates at distances smaller than the metal skin depth when using a
local dielectric constant and investigate the origin of this effect. The effect
of non-local corrections is analysed using the Lindhard-Mermin and
Boltzmann-Mermin models. We find that local and non-local models yield the same
heat fluxes for gaps larger than 2 nm. Finally, we explain the saturation
observed in a recent experiment as a manifestation of the skin depth and show
that heat is mainly dissipated by eddy currents in metallic bodies.
