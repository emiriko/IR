We have made experimental observations of the force networks within a
two-dimensional granular silo similar to the classical system of Janssen.
Models like that of Janssen predict that pressure within a silo saturates with
depth as the result of vertical forces being redirected to the walls of the
silo where they can then be carried by friction. By averaging ensembles of
experimentally-obtained force networks in different ways, we compare the
observed behavior with various predictions for granular silos. We identify
several differences between the mean behavior in our system and that predicted
by Janssen-like models: We find that the redirection parameter describing how
the force network transfers vertical forces to the walls varies with depth. We
find that changes in the preparation of the material can cause the pressure
within the silo to either saturate or to continue building with depth. Most
strikingly, we observe a non-linear response to overloads applied to the top of
the material in the silo. For larger overloads we observe the previously
reported "giant overshoot" effect where overload pressure decays only after an
initial increase [G. Ovarlez et al., Phys. Rev. E 67, 060302(R) (2003)]. For
smaller overloads we find that additional pressure propagates to great depth.
This effect depends on the particle stiffness, as given for instance by the
Young's modulus, E, of the material from which the particles are made.
Important measures include E, the unscreened hydrostatic pressure, and the
applied load. These experiments suggest that when the load and the particle
weight are comparable, particle elasticity acts to stabilize the force network,
allowing non-linear network effects to be seen in the mean behavior.
