A simple system composed of electronic oscillators capable of emitting and
detecting light-pulses is studied. The oscillators are biologically inspired,
their behavior is designed for keeping a desired light intensity, W, in the
system. From another perspective, the system behaves like modified integrate
and fire type neurons that are pulse-coupled with inhibitory type interactions:
the firing of one oscillator delays the firing of all the others. Experimental
and computational studies reveal that although no driving force favoring
synchronization is considered, for a given interval of W phase-locking appears.
This weak synchronization is sometimes accompanied by complex dynamical
patterns in the flashing sequence of the oscillators.
