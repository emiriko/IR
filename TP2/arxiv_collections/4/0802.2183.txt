Photoabsorption cross sections and gamma-decay strength function are
calculated and compared with experimental data to test the existing models of
dipole radiative strength functions (RSF) for the middle-weight and heavy
atomic nuclei. Simplified version of the modified Lorentzian model are
proposed. New tables of giant dipole resonance (GDR) parameters are given. It
is shown that the phenomenological closed-form models with asymmetric shape can
be used for overall estimates of the dipole RSF in the gamma -ray energy region
up to about 20 MeV when GDR parameters are known or the GDR systematics can be
adopted. Otherwise, the HFB-QRPA microscopic model and the semi-classical
approach with moving surface appear to be more adequate methods to estimate the
dipole photoabsorption RSF.
