Systems biology focuses on the study of entire biological systems rather than
on their individual components. With the emergence of high-throughput data
generation technologies for molecular biology and the development of advanced
mathematical modeling techniques, this field promises to provide important new
insights. At the same time, with the availability of increasingly powerful
computers, computer algebra has developed into a useful tool for many
applications. This article illustrates the use of computer algebra in systems
biology by way of a well-known gene regulatory network, the Lac Operon in the
bacterium E. coli.
