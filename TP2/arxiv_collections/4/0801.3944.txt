We characterize in terms of the Goldman Lie algebra which conjugacy classes
in the fundamental group of a surface with non empty boundary are represented
by simple closed curves. We prove the following: A non power conjugacy class X
contains an embedded representative if and only if the Goldman Lie bracket of X
with the third power of X is zero. The proof uses combinatorial group theory
and Chas' combinatorial description of the bracket recast here in terms of an
exposition of the Cohen-Lustig algorithm. Using results of Ivanov, Korkmaz and
Luo there are corollaries characterizing which permutations of conjugacy
classes are related to diffeomorphisms of the surfaces. The problem is
motivated by a group theoretical statement from the sixties equivalent to the
Poincare conjecture due to Jaco and Stallings and by a question of Turaev from
the eighties. Our main theorem actually counts the minimal possible number of
self-intersection points of representatives of a conjugacy class X in terms of
the bracket of X with the third power of X.
