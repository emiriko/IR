The ability of entanglement renormalization (ER) to generate a proper
real-space renormalization group (RG) flow in extended quantum systems is
analysed in the setting of harmonic lattice systems in D=1 and D=2 spatial
dimensions. A conceptual overview of the steps involved in momentum-space RG is
provided and contrasted against the equivalent steps in the real-space setting.
The real-space RG flow, as generated by ER, is compared against the exact
results from momentum-space RG, including an investigation of a critical fixed
point and the effect of relevant and irrelevant perturbations.
