The degrees of polynomials representing or approximating Boolean functions
are a prominent tool in various branches of complexity theory. Sherstov
recently characterized the minimal degree deg_{\eps}(f) among all polynomials
(over the reals) that approximate a symmetric function f:{0,1}^n-->{0,1} up to
worst-case error \eps: deg_{\eps}(f) = ~\Theta(deg_{1/3}(f) +
\sqrt{n\log(1/\eps)}). In this note we show how a tighter version (without the
log-factors hidden in the ~\Theta-notation), can be derived quite easily using
the close connection between polynomials and quantum algorithms.
