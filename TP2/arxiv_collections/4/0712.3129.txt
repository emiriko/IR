Using coherent and squeezed state formalisms of quantum optics for a
minimally coupled non-classical inflaton in the FRW mertic is studied, in
semiclassical theory of gravity. The leading order solution for the
semiclassical Einstein equations in the coherent, squeezed and squeezed vacuum
states are obtained perturbatively and are exhibit powerlaw expansion
behaviour. The validity of the semiclassical theory is examined in the squeezed
vacuum state in the oscillatory phase of the inflaton. The semiclassical theory
in the oscillatory phase of the non-classical inflaton holds only if the
associated squeezing parameter is much less compared to unity. Quantum
fluctuations of the inflaton is also examined in coherent and squeezed state
formalisms.
