To obtain further information on the geometric shape of the nucleon, the
proton charge form factor is decomposed into two terms, which are connected
respectively with a spherically symmetric and an intrinsic quadrupole part of
the proton's charge density. Quark model relations are employed to derive
expressions for both terms. In particular, the proton's intrinsic quadrupole
form factor is obtained from a relation between the N -> Delta and neutron
charge form factors. The proposed decomposition shows that the neutron charge
form factor is an observable manifestation of an intrinsic quadrupole form
factor of the nucleon. Furthermore, it affords an interpretation of recent
electron-nucleon scattering data in terms of a nonspherical distribution of
quark-antiquark pairs in the nucleon.
