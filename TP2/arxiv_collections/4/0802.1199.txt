We demonstrate how a time-dependent dissipative environment may be used as a
tool for controlling the quantum state of a two-level atom. In our model system
the frequency and coupling strength associated with microscopic reservoir modes
are modulated, while the principal features of the reservoir structure remain
fixed in time. Physically, this may be achieved by containing a static
atom-cavity system inside an oscillating external bath. We show that it is
possible to dynamically decouple the atom from its environment, despite the
fact that the two remain resonant at all times. This can lead to Markovian
dynamics, even for a strong atom-bath coupling, as the atomic decay becomes
inhibited into all but a few channels; the reservoir occupation spectrum
consequently acquires a sideband structure, with peaks separated by the
frequency of the environmental modulation. The reduction in the rate of
spontaneous emission using this approach can be significantly greater than
could be achieved with an oscillatory atom-bath detuning using the same
parameters.
