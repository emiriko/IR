We calculate the joint probabilities and the correlation function in
Einstein--Podolsky--Rosen type experiments with a massive vector boson in the
framework of quantum field theory. We report on the strange behavior of the
correlation function (and the probabilities) -- the correlation function, which
in the relativistic case still depends on the particle momenta, for some fixed
configurations has local extrema. We also show that relativistic spin-1
particles violate some Bell inequalities more than nonrelativistic ones and
that the degree of violation of the Bell inequality is momentum dependent.
