We report a detailed scaling analysis of resistivity \rho(T,n) measured for
several high-mobility 2D electron systems in the vicinity of the 2D
metal-insulator transition. We analyzed the data using the two parameter
scaling approach and general scaling ideas. This enables us to determine the
critical electron density, two critical indices, and temperature dependence for
the separatrix in the self-consistent manner. In addition, we reconstruct the
empirical scaling function describing a two-parameter surface which fits well
the \rho(T,n) data.
