We propose a method to cool atoms on a ring by combining an atom diode -a
laser valve for one-way atomic motion which induces robust internal state
excitation- and a trap. We demonstrate numerically that the atom is efficiently
slowed down at each diode crossing, and it is finally trapped when its velocity
is below the trap threshold.
