In this study, we report the observation of a pseudogap associated with the
insulator-metal transition in compositions of Pr$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$MnO$_3$ system
with no charge ordering. Our valence band photoemission study shows that the
observed shifts in the near Fermi level density of states are abrupt at the
Curie transtion and occur over an energy scale of $\sim$ 1 eV, strongly
suggesting that the charge-ordering gap observed earlier in other manganites
and the pseudogap observed here may indeed have same origin. These results
could be understood within the framework of models based on electronic phase
separation where it has been shown that the pseudogap is a generic feature of
the mixed-phase compositions. Also, our band structure calculations on
Pr$_{0.75}$Sr$_{0.25}$MnO$_3$ show the possible existence of half-metallicity
in this system.
