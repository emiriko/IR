In the context of photoelectron spectroscopy, the $GW$ approach has developed
into the method of choice for computing excitation spectra of weakly correlated
bulk systems and their surfaces. To employ the established computational
schemes that have been developed for three-dimensional crystals,
two-dimensional systems are typically treated in the repeated-slab approach. In
this work we critically examine this approach and identify three important
aspects for which the treatment of long-range screening in two dimensions
differs from the bulk: (1) anisotropy of the macroscopic screening (2) $\mathbf
k$-point sampling parallel to the surface (3) periodic repetition and slab-slab
interaction. For prototypical semiconductor (silicon) and ionic (NaCl) thin
films we quantify the individual contributions of points (1) to (3) and develop
robust and efficient correction schemes derived from the classic theory of
dielectric screening.
