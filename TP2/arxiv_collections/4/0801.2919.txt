We consider a model of Quantum Gravity phenomenology, based on the idea that
space-time may have some unknown granular structure that respects the Lorentz
symmetry. The proposal involves non-trivial couplings of curvature to matter
fields and leads to a well defined phenomenology. In this manuscript, a brief
description of the model is presented together with some results obtained using
linearized gravity and the Newtonian limit, which could be useful when
comparing with real experiments.
