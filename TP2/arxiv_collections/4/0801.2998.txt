In this work we calculate the leading electroweak (EW) corrections to the
anomalous $gt\bar{t}$ coupling in the Littlest Higgs model with T-parity (LHT),
by applying the Goldstone boson equivalence theorem. In the LHT model, such
electroweak corrections arise from the loop diagrams of heavy fermions and the
``would-be'' Goldstone bosons. We further examine the EW corrections in the top
quark pair production via the quark annihilation process at the LHC. The
negative EW corrections in the Standard Model are partially canceled by the
positive EW corrections from the loops of the new heavy particles, and the
latter dominates in the large invariant mass of the top quark pair.
