We observe velocity-selective two-photon resonances in a cold atom cloud in
the presence of a magnetic field. We use these resonances to demonstrate a
simple magnetometer with sub-mG resolution. The technique is particularly
useful for zeroing the magnetic field and does not require any additional laser
frequencies than are already used for standard magneto-optical traps. We verify
the effects using Faraday rotation spectroscopy.
