We discuss the low energy effective theory of an M5-brane wrapped on a smooth
holomorphic four-cycle of K3 x T^2, including the special case of T^6. In
particular we give the lowest order equations of motion and resolve a puzzle
concerning the counting of massless modes that was reported in hep-th/9906094.
In order to find agreement with black hole entropy and anomaly inflow arguments
we propose that some of the moduli become massive.
