The hysteretic ac loss of a current-carrying conductor in which multiple
superconducting strips are polygonally arranged around a cylindrical former is
theoretically investigated as a model of superconducting cables. Using the
critical state model, we analytically derive the ac loss $Q_n$ of a total of
$n$ strips. The normalized loss $Q_n/Q_1$ is determined by the number of strips
$n$ and the ratio of the strip width $2w$ to the diameter $2R$ of the
cylindrical former. When $n>> 1$ and $w/R<< 1$, the behavior of $Q_n$ is
similar to that of an infinite array of coplanar strips.
