We succeeded in the fabrication of high-Jc MgB2/Fe wires applying the
internal Mg diffusion (IMD) process with pure Mg core and SiC addition. A pure
Mg rod with 2 mm diameter was placed at the center of a Fe tube, and the space
between Mg and Fe tube was filled with B powder or the powder mixture of
B-(5mol%)SiC. The composite was cold worked into 1.2mm diameter wire and
finally heat treated at temperatures above the melting point of Mg(~650oC).
During the heat treatment liquid Mg infiltrated into B layer and reacted with B
to form MgB2. X-ray diffraction analysis indicated that the major phase in the
reacted layer is MgB2. SEM analysis shows that the density of MgB2 layer is
higher than that of usual powder-in-tube(PIT) processed wires. The wires with
5mol% SiC addition heat treated at 670oC showed Jc values higher than 105A/cm2
in 8T and 41,000A/cm2 in 10T at 4.2K. These values are much higher than those
of usual PIT processed wires even compared to the ones with SiC addition.
Higher density of MgB2 layer obtained by the diffusion reaction is the major
cause of this excellent Jc values.
