In contrast to standard critical phenomena, disordered systems need to be
treated via the Functional Renormalization Group. The latter leads to a coarse
grained disorder landscape, which after a finite renormalization becomes
non-analytic, thus overcoming the predictions of the seemingly exact
dimensional reduction. We review recent progress on how the non-analytic
effective action can be measured both in simulations and experiments, and
confront theory with numerical work.
