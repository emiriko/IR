We investigate electron and ion surface states of a negatively charged dust
particle in a gas discharge and identify the charge of the particle with the
electron surface density bound in the polarization-induced short-range part of
the particle potential. On that scale, ions do not affect the charge. They are
trapped in the shallow states of the Coulomb tail of the potential and act only
as screening charges. Using orbital-motion limited electron charging fluxes and
the particle temperature as an adjustable parameter, we obtain excellent
agreement with experimental data.
