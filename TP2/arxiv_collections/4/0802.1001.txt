The Einstein relation for a driven moderately dense granular gas in
$d$-dimensions is analyzed in the context of the Enskog kinetic equation. The
Enskog equation neglects velocity correlations but retains spatial correlations
arising from volume exclusion effects. As expected, there is a breakdown of the
Einstein relation $\epsilon=D/(T_0\mu)\neq 1$ relating diffusion $D$ and
mobility $\mu$, $T_0$ being the temperature of the impurity. The kinetic theory
results also show that the violation of the Einstein relation is only due to
the strong non-Maxwellian behavior of the reference state of the impurity
particles. The deviation of $\epsilon$ from unity becomes more significant as
the solid volume fraction and the inelasticity increase, especially when the
system is driven by the action of a Gaussian thermostat. This conclusion
qualitatively agrees with some recent simulations of dense gases [Puglisi {\em
et al.}, 2007 {\em J. Stat. Mech.} P08016], although the deviations observed in
computer simulations are more important than those obtained here from the
Enskog kinetic theory. Possible reasons for the quantitative discrepancies
between theory and simulations are discussed.
