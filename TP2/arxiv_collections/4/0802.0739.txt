We examine the effects of an unparticle $\mathcal{U}$ as a possible source of
missing energy in the p-wave decays of $B$ meson. The dependence of the
differential branching ratio on the $K_{0}^{\ast}(K_{1}) -$% meson's energy is
discussed in the presence of scalar and vector unparticle operators and
significant deviation from the standard model value is found after addition of
these operators. Finally, we have shown the dependence of branching ratio for
the above said decays on the parameters of the unparticle stuff like the
effective couplings, cutoff scale $\Lambda_{% \mathcal{U}}$ and the scale
dimensions $d_{\mathcal{U}}$.
