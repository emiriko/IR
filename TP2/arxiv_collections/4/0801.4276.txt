We introduce a model which incorporate the subdiffusive dynamics and the
ratchet effect. Using a subordination ideology, we show that the resulting
directed transport is sublinear, $<x(t)> \simeq Jt^{\beta}$, $\beta < 1$. The
proposed model may be relevant to a phenomenon of saltatory microbiological
motility.
