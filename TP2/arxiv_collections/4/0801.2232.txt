We discuss a possible interpretation of the scalar Bs0*(5725) and axial
Bs1(5778) bottom-strange mesons as hadronic molecules - bound states of B K and
B* K mesons, respectively. Using a phenomenological Lagrangian approach we
analyze the strong Bs0* to Bs pi0, Bs1 to Bs* pi0 and the radiative Bs0* to Bs*
gamma, Bs1 to Bs gamma, Bs1 to Bs* gamma, Bs1 to Bs0* gamma decays. We give
predictions for the decay properties: effective couplings and decay widths.
