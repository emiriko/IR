There are 10 generalized Kac-Moody algebras whose denominator identities are
completely reflective automorphic products of singular weight on lattices of
squarefree level. Under the assumption that the meromorphic vertex operator
algebra of central charge 24 and spin-1 algebra $\hat{A}_{p-1,p}^r$ exists we
show that four of them can be constructed in a uniform way from bosonic strings
moving on suitable target spaces.
