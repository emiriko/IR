A clustering algorithm based on the Hausdorff distance is introduced and
compared to the single and complete linkage. The three clustering procedures
are applied to a toy example and to the time series of financial data. The
dendrograms are scrutinized and their features confronted. The Hausdorff
linkage relies of firm mathematical grounds and turns out to be very effective
when one has to discriminate among complex structures.
