We give a geometric criterion for the breakdown of an Einstein vacuum
space-time foliated by a constant mean curvature, or maximal, foliation. More
precisely we show that the foliated space-time can be extended as long as the
the second fundamental form and the first derivatives of the logarithm of the
lapse of the foliation remain uniformly bounded. No restrictions on the size of
the initial data are made.
