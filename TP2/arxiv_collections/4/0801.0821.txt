We outline a quantum convolutional coding technique for protecting a stream
of classical bits and qubits. Our goal is to provide a framework for designing
codes that approach the ``grandfather'' capacity of an entanglement-assisted
quantum channel for sending classical and quantum information simultaneously.
Our method incorporates several resources for quantum redundancy: fresh ancilla
qubits, entangled bits, and gauge qubits. The use of these diverse resources
gives our technique the benefits of both active and passive quantum error
correction. We can encode a classical-quantum bit stream with periodic quantum
gates because our codes possess a convolutional structure. We end with an
example of a ``grandfather'' quantum convolutional code that protects one qubit
and one classical bit per frame by encoding them with one fresh ancilla qubit,
one entangled bit, and one gauge qubit per frame. We explicitly provide the
encoding and decoding circuits for this example.
