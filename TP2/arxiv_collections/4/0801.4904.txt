We present results of 2-particle jet-like correlations, with high pT h+-
triggers and identified pi+-, p, and pbar triggers in d+Au and Au+Au collisions
and 3-particle jet-like azimuthal correlations in pp, d+Au, and Au+Au
collisions at sqrt(s)=200 GeV. These results use data from the STAR TPC during
RHIC runs II, III, and IV. Modifications in 2-particle correlations are
observed in Au+Au collisions. These modifications are not seen in $pp$ or d+Au
collisions. This demonstrates that the modifications are due to final state
nuclear effects. High pT protons, anti-protons and charged pions are identified
by the relativistic rise of dE/dx in the STAR TPC. Correlations of charged
hadrons with high pT p, pbar, and pi+- show no discernible difference. The
results post challenges to recombination and coalescence models which are
otherwise very successful in explaining the large baryon/meson ratio and the
splitting of the elliptic flow at intermediate pT. In central Au+Au collisions,
the away-side 2-particle correlation is significantly broadened and even double
humped in selective kinematic ranges. Three-particle correlations were employed
to identify the underlying physics mechanism(s). Results in pp, d+Au and
peripheral Au+Au collisions show dijet structure with away-side kT broadening.
Results in mid-central and central Au+Au collisions are consistent with a
near-side jet and on the away-side a combination of conical emission and large
angle gluon radiation and deflected jets. The associated pT independent
emission angle suggests Mach-cone shock waves being the underlying physics
mechanism for the conical emission. The emission angle is measured to be
1.39+-0.01 (stat.)+-0.04(sys.) in ZDC triggered 0-12% Au+Au data.
