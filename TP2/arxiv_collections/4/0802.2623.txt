Planar reconstruction patterns at the zigzag and armchair edges of graphene
were investigated with density functional theory. It was unexpectedly found
that the zigzag edge is metastable and a planar reconstruction spontaneously
takes place at room temperature. The reconstruction changes electronic
structure and self-passivates the edge with respect to adsorption of atomic
hydrogen from molecular atmosphere.
