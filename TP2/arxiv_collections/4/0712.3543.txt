A model for ternary fission is discussed in which a third particle
(alpha-particle) is emitted due to non-adiabatic change of the nuclear
potential at neck rapture. An expression for energy and angular distribution of
alpha-particles is proposed. It is shown that an interaction between spin of
fissioning system and orbital momentum of alpha-particle (spin-orbit
interaction in the final state) results in recently observed asymmetry of
alpha-particle emission, which can be formally related to T-odd correlation. No
strong dependence of the asymmetry on the angle of alpha-particle emission with
respect to the fission axis is predicted by the model in accordance with the
experimental data.
