A fully-connected qubit network is considered, where every qubit interacts
with every other one. When the interactions between the qubits are homogeneous,
the system is a special case of the finite Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model. We
propose a natural implementation of this model using superconducting qubits in
state-of-the-art circuit QED. The ground state, the low-lying energy spectrum
and the dynamical evolution are investigated. We find that, under realistic
conditions, highly entangled states of Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger and W types
can be generated. We also comment on the influence of disorder on the system
and discuss the possibility of simulating complex quantum systems, such as
Sherrington-Kirkpatrick spin glasses, with superconducting qubit networks.
