We first devise a scheme to perform a universal entangling gate via
controlled collisions between pairs of atomic qubits trapped with optical
tweezers. Second, we present a modification to this scheme to allow the
preparation of atomic Bell pairs via selective excitation, suitable for quantum
information processing applications that do not require universality. Both
these schemes are enabled by the inherent symmetries of identical composite
particles, as originally proposed by Hayes et al. Our scheme provides a
technique for producing weighted graph states, entangled resources for quantum
communication, and a promising approach to performing a "loophole free" Bell
test in a single laboratory.
