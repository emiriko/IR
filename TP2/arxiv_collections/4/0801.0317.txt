In this work we analyze the relation between the multiplicative decomposition
$\mathbf F=\mathbf F^{e}\mathbf F^{p}$ of the deformation gradient as a product
of the elastic and plastic factors and the theory of uniform materials. We
prove that postulating such a decomposition is equivalent to having a uniform
material model with two configurations - total $\phi$ and the inelastic
$\phi_{1}$. We introduce strain tensors characterizing different types of
evolutions of the material and discuss the form of the internal energy and that
of the dissipative potential. The evolution equations are obtained for the
configurations $(\phi,\phi_{1})$ and the material metric $\mathbf g$.
  Finally the dissipative inequality for the materials of this type is
presented.It is shown that the conditions of positivity of the internal
dissipation terms related to the processes of plastic and metric evolution
provide the anisotropic yield criteria.
