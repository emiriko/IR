We report measurement of inelastic loss in dense and cold metastable
ytterbium (Yb[$^3P_2$]). Use of an optical far-off-resonance trap enables us to
trap atoms in all magnetic sublevels, removing multichannel collisional trap
loss from the system. Trapped samples of Yb[$^3P_2$] are produced at a density
of 2$\times10^{13}$ cm$^{-3}$ and temperature of 2 $\mu$K. We observe rapid
two-body trap loss of Yb[$^3P_2$] and measure the inelastic collision rate
constant 1.0(3)$\times10^{-11}$ cm$^3$s$^{-1}$. The existence of the
fine-structure changing collisions between atoms in the $^3P_2$ state is
strongly suggested.
