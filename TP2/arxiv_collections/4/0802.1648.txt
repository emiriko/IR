The contact value of the charge profile for nonsymmetrical electrolytes is
presented as the sum of three contributions. One of them is the normal
component of the Maxwell electrostatic stress tensor. The second one is the
surface electrostatic property defined as the integral of the product of the
gradient of the electrical potential and the density distribution function of
coions. The third term is the bulk contribution defined by the sum for anions
and for cations of the product of their charge and their partial pressure. For
noncharged surfaces only the last two are present and have the same sign in the
case of size asymmetry. In the case of charge asymmetry the contact value of
the charge profile is the result of the competitions of bulk and surface terms
in which the bulk term is dominant. Using both the contact theorems for the
density and the charge profiles, the exact expressions for the contact values
of the profiles of coions and counterions are obtained and some related
properties are discussed.
