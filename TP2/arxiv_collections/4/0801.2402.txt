The Halperin $(m,m',n)$ bilayer quantum Hall states are studied on thin
cylinders. In this limit, charge density wave patterns emerge that are
characteristic of the underlying quantum Hall state. The general patterns are
worked out from a variant of the plasma analogy. Torus degeneracies are
recovered, and for some important special cases a connection to well-known spin
chain physics is made. By including interlayer tunneling, we also work out the
critical behavior of a possible phase transition between the $(331)$ state and
the non-abelian Moore-Read state in the thin cylinder limit.
