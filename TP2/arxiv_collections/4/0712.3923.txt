We analyze the branching ratio and spectrum for the decay mode $K^+
\to\pi^++{\not}E$(missing energy) in the unparticle model, where an unparticle
can also serve as the missing energy. A vector unparticle can even mediate the
$K^+ \to \pi^+ +\nu \bar{\nu}$, resulting complicated interference with the
Standard Model.
