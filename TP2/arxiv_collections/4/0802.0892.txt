We obtain a complete description of closed ideals in weighted Lipschitz
algebras $\Lambda_\omega$ of analytic functions on the unit disk satisfying the
following condition $$\frac{|f(z)-f(w)|}{\omega(|z-w|)}=o(1)\qquad(as |z-w|
\longrightarrow 0),$$ where $\omega$ is a modulus of continuity satisfying some
regularity conditions.
