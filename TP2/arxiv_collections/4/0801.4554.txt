This review summarizes the motivations for and phenomenological consequences
of nonstandard Higgs boson decays, with emphasis on final states containing a
pair of non-Standard-Model particles that subsequently decay to Standard Model
particles. Typically these non-Standard-Model particles are part of a
``hidden'' sector, for example a pair of neutral Higgs bosons or a pair of
unstable neutralinos. We emphasize that such decays allow for a Higgs
substantially below the Standard Model Higgs LEP limit of 114 GeV. This in turn
means that the ``fine-tuning'' problems of many Beyond the Standard Model (BSM)
theories, in particular supersymmetric models, can be eliminated while
achieving excellent consistency with precision electroweak data which favor a
Higgs boson with mass below $100\gev$ and standard $WW$, $ZZ$, and top
couplings.
