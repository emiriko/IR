Using density functional theory (DFT), we analyze the influence of five
classes of functional groups, as exemplified by NO2, OCH3, CH3, CCl3, and I, on
the transport properties of a 1,4-benzenedithiolate (BDT) and
1,4-benzenediamine (BDA) molecular junction with gold electrodes. Our analysis
demonstrates how ideas from functional group chemistry may be used to engineer
a molecule's transport properties, as was shown experimentally and using a
semiempirical model for BDA [Nano Lett. 7, 502 (2007)]. In particular, we show
that the qualitative change in conductance due to a given functional group can
be predicted from its known electronic effect (whether it is pi/sigma
donating/withdrawing). However, the influence of functional groups on a
molecule's conductance is very weak, as was also found in the BDA experiments.
The calculated DFT conductances for the BDA species are five times larger than
the experimental values, but good agreement is obtained after correcting for
self-interaction and image charge effects.
