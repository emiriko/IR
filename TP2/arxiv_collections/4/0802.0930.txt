The fractional quantum Hall effect, where plateaus in the Hall resistance at
values of coexist with zeros in the longitudinal resistance, results from
electron correlations in two dimensions under a strong magnetic field. Current
flows along the edges carried by charged excitations (quasi particles) whose
charge is a fraction of the electron charge. While earlier research
concentrated on odd denominator fractional values of $\nu$, the observation of
the even denominator $\nu=5/2$ state sparked a vast interest. This state is
conjectured to be characterized by quasiparticles of charge e/4, whose
statistics is non-abelian. In other words, interchanging of two quasi particles
may modify the state of the system to an orthogonal one, and does not just add
a phase as in for fermions or bosons. As such, these quasiparticles may be
useful for the construction of a topological quantum computer. Here we report
data of shot noise generated by partitioning edge currents in the $\nu=5/2$
state, consistent with the charge of the quasiparticle being e/4, and
inconsistent with other potentially possible values, such as e/2 and e. While
not proving the non-abelian nature of the $\nu=5/2$ state, this observation is
the first step toward a full understanding of these new fractional charges.
