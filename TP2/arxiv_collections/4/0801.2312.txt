A first-principles calculation of the impurity screening in Si and Ge
nanocrystals is presented. We show that isocoric screening gives results in
agreement with both the linear response and the point-charge approximations.
Based on the present ab initio results, and by comparison with previous
calculations, we propose a physical real-space interpretation of the several
contributions to the screening. Combining the Thomas-Fermi theory and simple
electrostatics, we show that it is possible to construct a model screening
function that has the merit of being of simple physical interpretation. The
main point upon which the model is based is that, up to distances of the order
of a bond length from the perturbation, the charge response does not depend on
the nanocrystal size. We show in a very clear way that the link between the
screening at the nanoscale and in the bulk is given by the surface
polarization. A detailed discussion is devoted to the importance of local field
effects in the screening. Our first-principles calculations and the
Thomas-Fermi theory clearly show that in Si and Ge nanocrystals, local field
effects are dominated by surface polarization, which causes a reduction of the
screening in going from the bulk down to the nanoscale. Finally, the model
screening function is compared with recent state-of-the-art ab initio
calculations and tested with impurity activation energies.
