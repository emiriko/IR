Gradual evolution of two phase coexistence between dynamical and static
regimes in cuprates is first investigated in the real space by making use of
the available neutron scattering, NMR and mSR data. Analysis of the Hall effect
and the ARPES spectra reveals the presence of two groups of charge carriers in
LSCO. The T-dependent component is due to the thermal activation of bound
electron-hole structures seen near antinodal points in the Brillouin zone, thus
introducing the two-component physics also for the momentum representation.
Interpretation of so-called "van Hove bands" undergoes drastic changes.
Importance of the findings for pseudo-gap physics is stressed. Relation to some
recent STM and STS results is discussed.
