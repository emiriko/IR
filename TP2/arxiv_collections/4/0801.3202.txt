We collect evidences on existence of microscopic solitons, and their
determining role in electronic processes of quasi-1D conductors. The
ferroelectric charge ordering gives access to several types of solitons in
conductivity and permittivity, and to solitons' bound pairs in optics - both in
insulating and conducting cases of TMTTF and TMTSF subfamilies. The excursion
to physics of conjugated polymers allows to suggest further experiments.
Internal tunnelling in Charge Density Waves goes through the channel of
"amplitude solitons", which correspond to the long sought quasi-particle - the
spinon. The same experiment gives an access to the reversible reconstruction of
the junction via spontaneous creation of a lattice of 2Pi solitons - a grid of
dislocations. The individual 2Pi solitons have been visually captured in recent
STM experiments. Junctions of organic and oxide conductors are anticipated to
show similar effects of reconstruction.
