The condition for the appearance of dynamical instability of the
Bose-condensed system, characterized by the emergence of complex eigenvalues in
the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations, is studied analytically. We perturbatively
expand both the Gross-Pitaevskii and Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations with
respect to the coupling constant. It is concluded that the degeneracy between a
positive-norm eigenmode and a negative-norm one is essential for the emergence
of complex modes. Based on the conclusion, we justify the two-mode
approximation applied in our previous work [E. Fukuyama \textit{et al}., Phys.
Rev. A {\bf 76}, 043608 (2007)], in which we analytically studied the condition
for the existence of complex modes when the condensate has a highly quantized
vortex.
