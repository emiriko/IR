The problem of biclustering consists of the simultaneous clustering of rows
and columns of a matrix such that each of the submatrices induced by a pair of
row and column clusters is as uniform as possible. In this paper we approximate
the optimal biclustering by applying one-way clustering algorithms
independently on the rows and on the columns of the input matrix. We show that
such a solution yields a worst-case approximation ratio of 1+sqrt(2) under
L1-norm for 0-1 valued matrices, and of 2 under L2-norm for real valued
matrices.
