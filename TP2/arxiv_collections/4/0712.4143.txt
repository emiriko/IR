We consider the cosmological symmetry reduction of the Plebanski action as a
toy-model to explore, in this simple framework, some issues related to loop
quantum gravity and spin-foam models. We make the classical analysis of the
model and perform both path integral and canonical quantizations. As for the
full theory, the reduced model admits two types of classical solutions:
topological and gravitational ones. The quantization mixes these two solutions,
which prevents the model to be equivalent to standard quantum cosmology.
Furthermore, the topological solution dominates at the classical limit. We also
study the effect of an Immirzi parameter in the model.
