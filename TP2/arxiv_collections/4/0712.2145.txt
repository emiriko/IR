We perform a theoretical analysis of atomic four-wave mixing via a collision
of two Bose-Einstein condensates of metastable helium atoms, and compare the
results to a recent experiment. We calculate atom-atom pair correlations within
the scattering halo produced spontaneously during the collision. We also
examine the expected relative number squeezing of atoms on the sphere. The
analysis includes first-principles quantum simulations using the positive
P-representation method. We develop a unified description of the experimental
and simulation results.
