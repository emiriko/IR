Within the framework of the mean-field-hydrodynamic model of a degenerate
Fermi gas (DFG), we study, by means of numerical methods and variational
approximation (VA), the formation of fundamental gap solitons (FGSs) in a DFG
(or in a BCS superfluid generated by weak interaction between spin-up and
spin-down fermions), which is trapped in a periodic optical-lattice (OL)
potential. An effectively one-dimensional (1D) configuration is considered,
assuming strong transverse confinement; in parallel, a proper 1D model of the
DFG (which amounts to the known quintic equation for the Tonks-Girardeau gas in
the OL) is considered too. The FGSs found in the first two bandgaps of the
OL-induced spectrum (unless they are very close to edges of the gaps) feature a
tightly-bound shape, being essentially confined to a single cell of the OL. In
the second bandgap, we also find antisymmetric tightly-bound subfundamental
solitons (SFSs), with zero at the midpoint. The SFSs are also confined to a
single cell of the OL, but, unlike the FGSs, they are unstable. The predicted
solitons, consisting of $\sim 10^4 - 10^5$ atoms, can be created by available
experimental techniques in the DFG of $^6$Li atoms.
