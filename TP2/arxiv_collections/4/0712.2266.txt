We present several recent analyses of Dalitz plots from the CLEO-c
experiment, including published and preliminary analyses of D+ to pi- pi+ pi+,
D+ to K- pi+ pi+, and D0 to K0_{S,L} pi+ pi- decays. More information on these
analyses can be found in References [1-3]. New preliminary analyses we present
include a search for CP asymmetry in D+ to K+ K- pi+ decays and a Dalitz plot
analysis of D0 to K0_{S} pi0 pi0. We report on a search for the CP asymmetry in
the singly Cabibbo-suppressed decay D+ to K+ K- pi+ using a data sample of 572
pb^{-1} accumulated with the CLEO-c detector and taken at the e+ e- to
psi(3770) resonance. We have searched for CP asymmetries using a Dalitz plot
based analysis that determines the amplitudes and relative phases of the
intermediate states. We also use a 281 pb^{-1} CLEO-c data sample taken at the
e+ e- to psi(3770) resonance to study the D0 to K0_S pi0 pi0 Dalitz plot. Our
nominal fit includes the K0_S, K*(892), f_0(980), f_0(1370), and K*(1680)
resonances.
