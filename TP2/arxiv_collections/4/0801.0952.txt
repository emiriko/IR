We study the Mott transition occurring for bosonic Hubbard models in one,
two, and three spatial dimensions, by means of a variational wave function
benchmarked by Green's function Monte Carlo calculations. We show that a very
accurate variational wave function, constructed by applying a long-range
Jastrow factor to the non-interacting boson ground state, can describe the
superfluid-insulator transition in any dimensionality. Moreover, by mapping the
quantum averages over such a wave function into the the partition function of a
classical model, important insights into the insulating phase are uncovered.
Finally, the evidence in favor of anomalous scenarios for the Mott transition
in two dimensions are reported whenever additional long-range repulsive
interactions are added to the Hamiltonian.
