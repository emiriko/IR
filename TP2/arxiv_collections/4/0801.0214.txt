A multidimensional chaos is generated by a special initial value problem for
the non-autonomous impulsive differential equation. The existence of a chaotic
attractor is shown, where density of periodic solutions, sensitivity of
solutions and existence of a trajectory dense in the set of all orbits are
observed. The chaotic properties of all solutions are discussed. An appropriate
example is constructed, where the intermittency phenomenon is indicated. The
results of the paper are illustrating that impulsive differential equations may
play a special role in the investigation of the complex behavior of dynamical
systems, different from that played by continuous dynamics.
