Background: The computation of the statistical properties of motif
occurrences has an obviously relevant practical application: for example,
patterns that are significantly over- or under-represented in the genome are
interesting candidates for biological roles. However, the problem is
computationally hard; as a result, virtually all the existing pipelines use
fast but approximate scoring functions, in spite of the fact that they have
been shown to systematically produce incorrect results. A few interesting exact
approaches are known, but they are very slow and hence not practical in the
case of realistic sequences. Results: We give an exact solution, solely based
on deterministic finite-state automata (DFAs), to the problem of finding not
only the p-value, but the whole relevant part of the Markovian probability
distribution function of a motif in a biological sequence. In particular, the
time complexity of the algorithm in the most interesting regimes is far better
than that of Nuel (2006), which was the fastest similar exact algorithm known
to date; in many cases, even approximate methods are outperformed. Conclusions:
DFAs are a standard tool of computer science for the study of patterns, but so
far they have been sparingly used in the study of biological motifs. Previous
works do propose algorithms involving automata, but there they are used
respectively as a first step to build a Finite Markov Chain Imbedding (FMCI),
or to write a generating function: whereas we only rely on the concept of DFA
to perform the calculations. This innovative approach can realistically be used
for exact statistical studies of very long genomes and protein sequences, as we
illustrate with some examples on the scale of the human genome.
