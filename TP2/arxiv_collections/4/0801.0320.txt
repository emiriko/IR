We examine implications of anthropogenic low pressure regions, - created by
injecting heat from nuclear reactors, into atmosphere. We suggest the
possibility that such artificially generated low pressure regions, near
hurricanes could disrupt their growth, path, and intensity. This method can
also create controlled tropical stroms, which lead to substantial rainfall in
arid areas, such as - (1)Sahara desert, (2) Australian interior desert, and (3)
Indian Thar desert. A simple vortex suction model is developed to study, effect
on atmospheric dynamics, by such a nuclear heat injection system.
