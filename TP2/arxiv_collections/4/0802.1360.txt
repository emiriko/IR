Degradable quantum channels are among the only channels whose quantum and
private classical capacities are known. As such, determining the structure of
these channels is a pressing open question in quantum information theory. We
give a comprehensive review of what is currently known about the structure of
degradable quantum channels, including a number of new results as well as
alternate proofs of some known results. In the case of qubits, we provide a
complete characterization of all degradable channels with two dimensional
output, give a new proof that a qubit channel with two Kraus operators is
either degradable or anti-degradable and present a complete description of
anti-degradable unital qubit channels with a new proof.
  For higher output dimensions we explore the relationship between the output
and environment dimensions ($d_B$ and $d_E$ respectively) of degradable
channels. For several broad classes of channels we show that they can be
modeled with a environment that is "small" in the sense $d_E \leq d_B$. Perhaps
surprisingly, we also present examples of degradable channels with ``large''
environments, in the sense that the minimal dimension $d_E > d_B$. Indeed, one
can have $d_E > \tfrac{1}{4} d_B^2$.
  In the case of channels with diagonal Kraus operators, we describe the
subclass which are complements of entanglement breaking channels. We also
obtain a number of results for channels in the convex hull of conjugations with
generalized Pauli matrices. However, a number of open questions remain about
these channels and the more general case of random unitary channels.
