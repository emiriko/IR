In the present analysis we study the transition from coherent to incoherent
dynamics in a nonlinear triplet of broad band combs of waves. Expanding the
analysis of previous works, this paper investigates what happens when the band
of available modes is much larger than that of the initial narrower combs
within which the nonlinear interaction is not subjected to selection rules
involving wave momenta. Here selection rules are present and active, and we
examine how and when coherence can be defined.
