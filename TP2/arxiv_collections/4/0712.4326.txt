A random matrix model of black holes is given based on analysis of Gaussian
complex ensembles, based on the generalization of chRMT of QCD. Spacetime
freedoms are incorporated in terms of eigenvalues of the ensemble. Classical
observables of black holes can be computed using this model and it satisfies
asymptotic freedom and holographic principle.
