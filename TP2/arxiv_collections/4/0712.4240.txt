In a perturbative QCD approach, with inclusion of spin and transverse
momentum effects, experimental data on azimuthal asymmetries observed in
polarized semi-inclusive deeply inelastic scattering and e+ e- annihilations
can be used to determine the Sivers, transversity and Collins soft functions.
By using these functions, within the same scheme, we predict p(transv.
polarized) p -> h + X single spin asymmetries in remarkable agreement with RHIC
experimental data.
