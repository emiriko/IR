The quantum mechanics of closed systems such as the universe is formulated
using an extension of familiar probability theory that incorporates negative
probabilities. Probabilities must be positive for sets of alternative histories
that are the basis of fair settleable bets. However, in quantum mechanics there
are sets of alternative histories that can be described but which cannot be the
basis for fair settleable bets. Members of such sets can be assigned extended
probabilities that are sometimes negative. A prescription for extended
probabilities is introduced that assigns extended probabilities to all
histories that can be described, fine grained or coarse grained, members of
decoherent sets or not. All probability sum rules are satisfied exactly. Sets
of histories that are recorded to sufficient precision are the basis of
settleable bets. This formulation is compared with the decoherent (consistent)
histories formulation of quantum theory. Prospects are discussed for using this
formulation to provide testable alternatives to quantum theory or further
generalizations of it.
