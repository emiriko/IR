We show that the Wilson loop operator for SU(N) Yang-Mills gauge connection
is exactly rewritten in terms of conserved gauge-invariant magnetic and
electric currents through a non-Abelian Stokes theorem of the Diakonov-Petrov
type. Here the magnetic current originates from the magnetic monopole derived
in the gauge-invariant way from the pure Yang--Mills theory even in the absence
of the Higgs scalar field, in sharp contrast to the 't Hooft-Polyakov magnetic
monopole in the Georgi-Glashow gauge-Higgs model. The resulting representation
indicates that the Wilson loop operator in fundamental representations can be a
probe for a single magnetic monopole irrespective of $N$ in SU(N) Yang-Mills
theory, against the conventional wisdom. Moreover, we show that the
quantization condition for the magnetic charge follows from the fact that the
non-Abelian Stokes theorem does not depend on the surface chosen for writing
the surface integral. The obtained geometrical and topological representations
of the Wilson loop operator have important implications to understanding quark
confinement according to the dual superconductor picture.
