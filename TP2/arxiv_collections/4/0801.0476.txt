Despite significant progress in synthesizing several new molecules and many
promising single device demonstrations, wide range acceptance of molecular
electronics as an alternative to CMOS technology has been stalled not only by
controversial theories of a molecular device`s operation, for example the
switching mechanism, but also by our inability to reproducibly fabricate large
arrays of devices. In this paper, we investigate the role of Casimir force as
one of the potential source of a wide range of discrepancies in the reported
electrical characteristics and high rate of device shorting in molecular
electronic switching junctions fabricated by sandwiching a molecular monolayer
between a pair of planar metal electrode.
