We observe chaotic dynamics in a damped linear oscillator, which is driven
only at certain regions of phase space. Both deterministic and random drives
are studied. The dynamics is characterized using standard techniques of
nonlinear dynamics. Interchanging roles of determinism and stochasticity is
also considered.
