We investigate the effect of nonlinearity in a system described by an
adiabatically evolving Hamiltonian. Experiments are conducted in a three-core
waveguide structure that is adiabatically varying with distance, in analogy to
the STIRAP process in atomic physics. In the linear regime, the system exhibits
an adiabatic power transfer between two waveguides which are not directly
coupled, with negligible power recorded in the intermediate coupling waveguide.
In the presence of nonlinearity the behavior of this configuration is
drastically altered and the adiabatic light passage is found to critically
depend on the excitation power. We show how this effect is related to the
destruction of the dark state formed in the STIRAP configuration.
