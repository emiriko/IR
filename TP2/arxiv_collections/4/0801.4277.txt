Having a far detector in Korea for the J-PARC neutrino beam in addition to
one at Kamioka has been shown to be a powerful way to lift neutrino parameter
($\Delta m^2$ and mixing angles) degeneracies. In this talk, I report the
sensitivity of the same experimental setup to nonstandard neutrino physics,
such as quantum decoherence, violation of Lorentz symmetry (with/without CPT
invariance), and nonstandard neutrino interactions with matter. In many cases,
two detector setup is better than one detector setup at SK. This observation
makes another support for the two detector setup.
