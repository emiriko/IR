With quantum interference of two-path spontaneous emissions, we propose a
novel scheme to coherently control the atom--photon momentum entanglement
through atomic internal coherence. A novel phenomenon called ``momentum phase
entanglement'' is reported, and we found, under certain conditions, that more
controllable entangled state can be produced with super--high degree of
entanglement.
