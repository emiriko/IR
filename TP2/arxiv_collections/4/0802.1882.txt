We consider RF-spectroscopy of ultracold Fermi gases by exact simulations of
the many-body state and the coherent dynamics in one dimension. Deviations from
the linear response sum rule result are found to suppress the pairing
contribution to the RF line shifts. We compare the coherent rotation and
quasiparticle descriptions of RF-spectroscopy which are analogous to NMR
experiments in superfluid $^3$He and tunneling in solids, respectively. We
suggest that RF-spectroscopy in ultracold gases provides an interesting
crossover between these descriptions that could be used for studying
decoherence in quantum measurement, in the context of many-body quantum states.
