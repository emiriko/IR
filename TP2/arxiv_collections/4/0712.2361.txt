The International Linear Collider (ILC) is a 200-500 GeV center-of-mass
high-luminosity linear electron-positron collider, based on 1.3 GHz
superconducting radio-frequency (SCRF) accelerating cavities. The ILC has a
total footprint of about 31 km and is designed for a peak luminosity of 2x10^34
cm^-2 s^-1. The complex includes a polarized electron source, an
undulator-based positron source, two 6.7 km circumference damping rings,
two-stage bunch compressors, two 11 km long main linacs and a 4.5 km long beam
delivery system. This report is Volume III (Accelerator) of the four volume
Reference Design Report, which describes the design and cost of the ILC.
