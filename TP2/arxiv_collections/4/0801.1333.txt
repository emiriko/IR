In this paper, we propose a novel method to compute the similarity between
congeneric nodes in bipartite networks. Different from the standard Person
correlation, we take into account the influence of node's degree. Substituting
this new definition of similarity for the standard Person correlation, we
propose a modified collaborative filtering (MCF). Based on a benchmark
database, we demonstrate the great improvement of algorithmic accuracy for both
user-based MCF and object-based MCF.
