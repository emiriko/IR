The dispersive character of the Hall-MHD solutions, in particular the
whistler waves, is a strong restriction to numerical treatments of this system.
Numerical stability demands a time step dependence of the form $\Delta t\propto
(\Delta x)^2$ for explicit calculations. A new semi--implicit scheme for
integrating the induction equation is proposed and applied to a reconnection
problem. It it based on a fix point iteration with a physically motivated
preconditioning. Due to its convergence properties, short wavelengths converge
faster than long ones, thus it can be used as a smoother in a nonlinear
multigrid method.
