We present a reliable and robust integrated fluorescence detector capable of
detecting single atoms. The detector consists of a tapered lensed single-mode
fiber for precise delivery of excitation light and a multimode fiber to collect
the fluorescence. Both are mounted in lithographically defined SU-8 holding
structures on an atom chip. Rb87 atoms propagating freely in a magnetic guide
are detected with an efficiency of up to 66%, and a signal-to-noise ratio in
excess of 100 is obtained for short integration times.
