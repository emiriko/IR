The He-McKellar-Wilkens(HMW) effect for spin one neutral particle in
non-commutative quantum mechanics is studied. By solving the Kemmer like
equations on non-commutative (NC) space and non-commutative phase space, we
obtain topological He-McKellar-Wilkens phase on NC space and NC phase space
respectively, where the additional terms related to the space-space and
momentum-momentum non-commutativity are given explicitly.
