We have studied the absorption of electromagnetic radiation of an anisotropic
quantum dot taking into account the spin-flip processes that is associated with
the interaction of the electrons with optical phonons. It is shown that these
processes lead to the resonance absorption. Explicit formula is derived for the
absorption coefficient. The positions of the resonances peaks are found.
