We investigate how the transport properties of a united atoms fluid with a
dissipative particle dynamics thermostat depend on the functional form and
magnitude of both the conservative and the stochastic interactions. We
demonstrate how the thermostat strongly affects the hydrodynamics, especially
diffusion, viscosity, and local escape times. As model system we use SPC water,
from which projected trajectories are used to determine the effective
interactions in the united atoms model. The simulation results support our
argument that the thermostat should be viewed as an integral part of the
coarse-grained dynamics, rather than a tool for approaching thermal
equilibrium. As our main result we show that the united atoms model with the
adjusted effective interactions approximately reproduce the diffusion constant
and the viscosity of the underlying detailed SPC water model.
