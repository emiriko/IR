The purpose of this paper is to initiate Arakelov theory in a noncommutative
setting. More precisely, we are concerned with noncommutative arithmetic
surfaces. We introduce a version of arithmetic intersection theory on
noncommutative arithmetic surfaces and we prove an arithmetic Riemann-Roch
theorem in this setup.
