We make a thorough study of the process of three body kaon absorption in
nuclei, in connection with a recent FINUDA experiment which claims the
existence of a deeply bound kaonic state from the observation of a peak in the
Lambda d invariant mass distribution following K- absorption on Li6. We show
that the peak is naturally explained in terms of K- absorption from three
nucleons leaving the rest as spectators. We can also reproduce all the other
observables measured in the same experiment and used to support the hypothesis
of the deeply bound kaon state. Our study also reveals interesting aspects of
kaon absorption in nuclei, a process that must be understood in order to make
progress in the search for K- deeply bound states in nuclei.
