In view of the recent experimental developments on the experimental side in
the $\eta \to \pi^0 \gamma \gamma$ decay, and the fact that the Particle Data
Group in the on line edition of 2007 reports sizable changes of the radiative
decay widths of vector mesons used as input in the theoretical calculations of
\cite{eta}, a reevaluation of the decay width of the $\eta$ in this channel has
been done, reducing its uncertainty by almost a factor of two. The new input of
the PDG is used and invariant mass distributions and total widths are compared
with the most recent results from AGS, MAMI and preliminary ones of KLOE. The
agreement of the theory with the AGS and MAMI data is very good, both for the
total rates as well as for the invariant mass distributions of the two photons.
