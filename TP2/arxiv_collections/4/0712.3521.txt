We report on the production of ^52Cr Bose Einstein Condensates (BEC) with an
all-optical method. We first load 5.10^6 metastable chromium atoms in a 1D
far-off-resonance optical trap (FORT) from a Magneto Optical Trap (MOT), by
combining the use of Radio Frequency (RF) frequency sweeps and depumping
towards the ^5S_2 state. The atoms are then pumped to the absolute ground
state, and transferred into a crossed FORT in which they are evaporated. The
fast loading of the 1D FORT (35 ms 1/e time), and the use of relatively fast
evaporative ramps allow us to obtain in 20 s about 15000 atoms in an almost
pure condensate.
