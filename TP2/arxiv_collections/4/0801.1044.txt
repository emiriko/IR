An innovative and accurate dynamic Compact Thermal Model extraction method is
proposed for multi-chip power electronics systems. It accounts for thermal
coupling between multiple heat sources. Transient electro-thermal coupling can
easily be taken into account by system designers. The method is based on a
definition of the Optimal Thermal Coupling Point, which is proven to be valid
even for transient modelling. Compared to the existing methods, the number of
needed 3D thermal simulations or measurements is significantly reduced.
