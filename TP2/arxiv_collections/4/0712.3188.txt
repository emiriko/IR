The cosmological constant (vacuum energy) problem is analyzed within the
scope of quantum theories with UV-cut-off or fundamental length. Various cases
associated with the appearance of the latter are considered both using the
Generalized Uncertainty Relations and the deformed density matrix,previously
introduced in the author's works. The use of the deformed density matrix is
examined in detail. It is demonstrated that, provided the Fischler-Susskind
cosmic holographic conjecture is valid, the Vacuum Energy Density takes a value
close to the experimental one. The arguments supporting the validity of this
conjecture are given on the basis of the recently obtained results on
Gravitational Holography.
