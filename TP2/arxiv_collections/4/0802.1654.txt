Recently, the authors studied the connection between each maximal monotone
operator T and a family H(T) of convex functions. Each member of this family
characterizes the operator and satisfies two particular inequalities.
  The aim of this paper is to establish the converse of the latter fact.
Namely, that every convex function satisfying those two particular inequalities
is associated to a unique maximal monotone operator.
