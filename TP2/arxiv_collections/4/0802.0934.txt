The mechanism by which a threshold may capture a resonance is examined. It
involves a threshold cusp interfering constructively with either or both (i) a
resonance produced via confinement, (ii) attractive t- and u-channel exchanges.
The fo(980), X(3872) and Z(4430) are studied in detail. The fo(980) provides a
valuable model of the locking mechanism. The X(3872) is too narrow to be fitted
by a cusp, and requires either a resonance or virtual state. The Z(4430) can be
fitted as a resonance but also can be fitted successfully by a cusp with no
nearby resonant pole.
