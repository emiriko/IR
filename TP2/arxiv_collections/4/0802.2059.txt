Heterogeneity is an important property of any population experiencing a
disease. Here we apply general methods of the theory of heterogeneous
populations to the simplest mathematical models in epidemiology. In particular,
an SIR (susceptible-infective-removed) model is formulated and analyzed for
different sources of heterogeneity. It is shown that a heterogeneous model can
be reduced to a homogeneous model with a nonlinear transmission function, which
is given in explicit form. The widely used power transmission function is
deduced from a heterogeneous model with the initial gamma-distribution of the
disease parameters. Therefore, a mechanistic derivation of the phenomenological
model, which mimics reality very well, is provided. The equation for the final
size of an epidemic for an arbitrary initial distribution is found. The
implications of population heterogeneity are discussed, in particular, it is
pointed out that usual moment-closure methods can lead to erroneous conclusions
if applied for the study of the long-term behavior of the model.
