We explore the deformation properties of the newly postulated BCP energy
density functional (EDF). The results obtained for three isotope chains of Mg,
Dy and Ra are compared to the available experimental data as well as to the
results of the Gogny-D1S force. Results for the fission barrier of $^{240}$Pu
are also discussed.
