Based on the idea of the work by Wilczek and his collaborators, we consider
the gravitational anomaly near weekly isolated horizon. We find that there
exists a universal choice of tortoise coordinate for any weakly isolated
horizon. Under this coordinate, the leading behavior of a quite arbitrary
scalar field near horizon is a 2-dimensional chiral scalar field. This means we
can extend the idea of Wilczek and his collaborators to more general cases and
show the relation between gravitational anomaly and Hawking radiation is a
universal property of black hole horizon.
