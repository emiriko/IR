This is an English translation of the paper M.B.Mensky, in: K.P.Stanyukovich
(ed.), "Problems of Theory of Gravity and Elementary Particles", issue 6,
Moscow, Atomizdat, 1975, p.181-190 (in Russian). This paper elaborates further
the idea (formulated in 1971 by Braginsky and Mensky) of detecting
high-frequency gravitational waves by observing resonance action of a
gravitational wave on the electromagnetic wave in a closed resonator
(waveguide). The phenomenon underlying such a detector was called
gravitational-electromagnetic resonance (GER). In the present paper both closed
(for example circular) resonator or waveguide and long (for example in the
shape of a spiral) waveguide are considered as possible gravitational-wave
detectors. High-frequency gravitational-wave detectors are now again actual
(see A.M.Cruise and R.M.J.Ingley, Class. Quant. Grav. 22, S479, 2005), but the
current literature on this topic does not cover all the issues discussed in the
present paper.
