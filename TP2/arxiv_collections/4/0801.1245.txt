This book objective is to develop an algebraization of graph grammars.
Equivalently, we study graph dynamics. From the point of view of a computer
scientist, graph grammars are a natural generalization of Chomsky grammars for
which a purely algebraic approach does not exist up to now. A Chomsky (or
string) grammar is, roughly speaking, a precise description of a formal
language (which in essence is a set of strings). On a more discrete
mathematical style, it can be said that graph grammars -- Matrix Graph Grammars
in particular -- study dynamics of graphs. Ideally, this algebraization would
enforce our understanding of grammars in general, providing new analysis
techniques and generalizations of concepts, problems and results known so far.
