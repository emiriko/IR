Cyclic predator-prey models with four or six species are studied on a square
lattice when the invasion rates are varied. It is found that the cyclic
invasions maintain a self-organizing pattern as long as the deviation of the
invasion rate(s) from a uniform value does not exceed a threshold value. For
larger deviations the system exhibits a continuous phase transition into a
frozen distribution of odd (or even) label species.
