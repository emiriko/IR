This paper presents a method to reduce the invasiveness of Computer Assisted
Orthopaedic Surgery (CAOS) using ultrasound. In this goal, we need to develop a
method for 3D/4D ultrasound registration. The premilinary results of this study
suggest that the development of a robust and ``realtime'' 3D/4D ultrasound
registration is feasible.
