In this paper a didactic approach is described which immediately leads to an
understanding of those postulates of quantum mechanics used most frequently in
quantum computation. Moreover, an interpretation of quantum mechanics is
presented which is motivated by retaining the point of view of classical
mechanics as much as possible, and which is consistent with relativity theory.
Everything can be written down in terms of well-known mathematical formulations
that can be found in every textbook about quantum mechanics. Therefore, in this
version, almost no formulas are used.
