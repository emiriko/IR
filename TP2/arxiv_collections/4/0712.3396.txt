Proteus mirabilis are bacteria that make strikingly regular spatial-temporal
patterns on agar surfaces. In this paper we investigate a mathematical model
that has been shown to display these structures when solved numerically. The
model consists of an ordinary differential equation coupled with a partial
differential equation involving a first-order hyperbolic aging term together
with nonlinear degenerate diffusion. The system is shown to admit global weak
solutions.
