Wave packet fractional revivals is a relevant feature in the long time scale
evolution of a wide range of physical systems, including atoms, molecules and
nonlinear systems. We show that the sum of information entropies in both
position and momentum conjugate spaces is an indicator of fractional revivals
by analyzing three different model systems: $(i)$ the infinite square well,
$(ii)$ a particle bouncing vertically against a wall in a gravitational field,
and $(iii)$ the vibrational dynamics of hydrogen iodide molecules. This
description in terms of information entropies complements the usual one in
terms of the autocorrelation function.
