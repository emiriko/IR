The aging of a charged colloidal system has been studied by Small Angle
X-rays Scattering, in the exchanged momentum range Q=0.03 - 5 nm-1, and by
Dynamic Light Scattering, at different clay concentrations (Cw =0.6 % - 2.8 %).
The static structure factor, S(Q), has been determined as a function of both
aging time and concentration. This is the first direct experimental evidence of
the existence and evolution with aging time of two different arrested states in
a single system simply obtained only by changing its volume fraction: an
inhomogeneous state is reached at low concentrations, while a homogenous one is
found at high concentrations.
