We prove that the non-ordinary component is connected in the moduli spaces of
finite flat models of two-dimensional local Galois representations over finite
fields. This was conjectured by Kisin. As an application to global Galois
representations, we prove a theorem on the modularity comparing a deformation
ring and a Hecke ring.
