An innovative method is proposed to generate configurations of coarse grained
models for polymer melts. This method, largely inspired by chemical ``radical
polymerization'', is divided in three stages: (i) nucleation of radicals
(reacting molecules caching monomers); (ii) growth of chains within a solvent
of monomers; (iii) termination: annihilation of radicals and removal of
residual monomers. The main interest of this method is that relaxation is
performed as chains are generated. Pure mono and poly-disperse polymers melts
are generated and compared to the configurations generated by the Push Off
method from Auhl et al.. A detailed study of the static properties (gyration
radius, mean square internal distance, entanglement length) confirms that the
radical-like polymerization technics is suitable to generate equilibrated
melts. The method is flexible, and can be adapted to generate nano-structured
polymers, namely diblock and triblock copolymers.
