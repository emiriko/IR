In the study of the basic properties observed in the immune system and, in a
broader view, in biological systems, several concepts have already been
mathematically formulated or treated in an analytical perspective, such as
degeneracy, robustness, noise, and bow tie architecture. These properties,
among others, seem to rule many aspects of the system functioning, and share
among themselvesseveral characteristics, intersecting each other, and often
becoming one the indivisible part of the other. According to Kitano, systems
biology needs solid theoretical and methodological foundation of principles and
properties, able to lead towards a unified perspective. An effort in unifying
the formalization and analysis of these principles can be now timely attempted.
