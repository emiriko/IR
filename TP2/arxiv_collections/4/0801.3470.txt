We calculate the free-streaming length and the phase space density of
dark-matter sterile neutrinos produced from decays, at the electroweak scale,
of a gauge singlet in the Higgs sector. These quantities, which depend on the
dark-matter production mechanism, are relevant to the study of small-scale
structure formation and may be used to constrain or rule out dark-matter
candidates.
