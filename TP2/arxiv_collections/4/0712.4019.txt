Doubly charged Higgs bosons (H^++) are a distinctive signature of the Higgs
Triplet Model of neutrino mass generation. If H^++ is relatively light
(m_{H^++} < 400GeV) it will be produced copiously at the LHC, which could
enable precise measurements of the branching ratios of the decay channels H^++
to l_i l_j. Such branching ratios are determined solely by the neutrino mass
matrix which allows the model to be tested at the LHC. We quantify the
dependence of the leptonic branching ratios on the absolute neutrino mass and
Majorana phases, and present the permitted values for the channels ee, emu and
mumu. It is shown that precise measurements of these three branching ratios are
sufficient to extract information on the neutrino mass spectrum and probe the
presence of CP violation from Majorana phases.
