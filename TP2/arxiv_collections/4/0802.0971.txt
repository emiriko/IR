The pion-polarizability functions are structure functions of pion-Compton
scattering. They can be assessed in high-energy pion-nucleus bremsstrahlung
reactions, $\pi^- +A\to\pi^- +\gamma +A$. We present numerical expectations for
pion-nucleus bremsstrahlung cross sections in the Coulomb region, i.e. the
small-angle region where the nuclear scattering is dominated by the Coulomb
interaction. We investigate the prospects of measuring the polarizability
functions for pion-Compton c.m. energies from threshold up to 1 GeV. A
meson-exchange model is used for the pion-Compton amplitude.
