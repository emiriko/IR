A scanning SQUID microscope was used to image vortex trapping as a function
of the magnetic induction during cooling in thin-film YBCO strips for strip
widths W from 2 to 50 um. We found that vortices were excluded from the strips
when the induction Ba was below a critical induction Bc. We present a simple
model for the vortex exclusion process which takes into account the vortex -
antivortex pair production energy as well as the vortex Meissner and
self-energies. This model predicts that the real density n of trapped vortices
is given by n=(Ba-BK)/Phi0 with BK = 1.65Phi0/W^2 and Phi0 = h/2e the
superconducting flux quantum. This prediction is in good agreement with our
experiments on YBCO, as well as with previous experiments on thin-film strips
of niobium. We also report on the positions of the trapped vortices. We found
that at low densities the vortices were trapped in a single row near the
centers of the strips, with the relative intervortex spacing distribution width
decreasing as the vortex density increased, a sign of longitudinal ordering.
The critical induction for two rows forming in the 35 um wide strip was (2.89 +
1.91-0.93)Bc, consistent with a numerical prediction.
