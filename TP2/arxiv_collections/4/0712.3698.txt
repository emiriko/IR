Work by Mandal and Jain [S. S. Mandal and J. K. Jain, Solid State Commun.
118, 503 (2001)] suggests that interaction induced mixing with the second
composite fermion Landau level can lead to renormalization of the electron
correlation function exponent in the fractional quantum Hall effect. In the
work reported here a similar mixing with the second electronic Landau level is
studied in the nu=1 integer case. The ground state is calculated by use of the
Hartree-Fock algorithm, and the electron density and electron correlation
function on the edge are calculated. It is shown that the interaction gives
rise to oscillations in the density profile. In particular, a short range
interaction gives a profile qualitatively similar to the results reported by
Mandal and Jain. On the other hand, no renormalization of the correlation
function exponent is found.
