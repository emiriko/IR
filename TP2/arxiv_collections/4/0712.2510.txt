It is shown, for the first time, that the zitterbewegung of photon can appear
near the Dirac point in two-dimensional photonic crystal. The superiority of
such a phenomenon for photons is that it can be found in different scaling
structures with wide frequency regions. It can be observed by measuring the
time dependence of the transmission coefficient through photonic crystal slabs.
Thus, it is particularly suited for experimentally observing this effect. We
have observed such a phenomenon by exact numerical simulations, confirming a
long-standing theoretical prediction.
