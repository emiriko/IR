We illustrate schematically a possible traversing along the path of
trefoil-type and $8_{18}$ knots during a specific time period by considering a
quantum-mechanic system which satisfies a specific kind of phase dynamics of
quantum mechanics. This result is relevant to the composite particle which is
present in the initial or final configuration.
