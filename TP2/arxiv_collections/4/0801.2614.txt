We have detected Lyman alpha radiation as a product of the n(3He,t)p nuclear
reaction occurring in a cell of 3He gas. The predominant source of this
radiation appears to be decay of the 2p state of tritium produced by charge
transfer and excitation collisions with the background 3He gas. Under the
experimental conditions reported here we find yields of tens of Lyman alpha
photons for every neutron reaction. These results suggest a method of cold
neutron detection that is complementary to existing technologies that use
proportional counters. In particular, this approach may provide single neutron
sensitivity with wide dynamic range capability, and a class of neutron
detectors that are compact and operate at relatively low voltages.
