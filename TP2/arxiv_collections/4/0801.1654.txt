I offer some historical comments about the origins of Feynman's path integral
approach, as an alternative approach to standard quantum mechanics. Looking at
the interaction between Einstein and Feynman, which was mediated by Feynman's
thesis supervisor John Wheeler, it is argued that, contrary to what one might
expect, the significance of the interaction between Einstein and Feynman
pertained to a critique of classical field theory, rather than to a direct
critique of quantum mechanics itself. Nevertheless, the critical perspective on
classical field theory became a motivation and point of departure for Feynman's
space-time approach to non-relativistic quantum mechanics.
