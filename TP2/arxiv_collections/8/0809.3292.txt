We experimentally studied the polarization dynamics (orientation and
ellipticity) of near infrared light transmitted through magnetooptic Yttrium
Iron Garnet crystal pairs using a modified balanced detection scheme. When the
pair separation is in the sub-millimeter range, we observed a proximity effect
in which the saturation field is reduced by up to 20%. 1D magnetostatic
calculations suggest that the proximity effect originates from magnetostatic
interactions between the dipole moments of the isolator crystals. This
substantial reduction of the saturation field is potentially useful for the
realization of low-power integrated magneto-optical devices.
