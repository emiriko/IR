The equivalence between the N-particle Calogero-Moser systems and the
integrable sl(N,$\mathbb{C}$)-tops is shown. New rational and trigonometric
classical Lax operators for these systems are found. Relations with new
solutions of the classical Yang-Baxter equations for sl(N,$\mathbb{C}$) are
discussed. Explicit formulae for N=2,3,4 are presented.
