We propose the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) as a well-suited
candidate for superheavy dark matter (SHDM). Various production mechanisms at
the end of inflation can produce SHDM with the correct abundance, $\Omega_{LSP}
h^2 \sim 0.1$, if its mass is sufficiently high. In particular, gravitational
production requires that the mass $m_{LSP}$ of the LSP is above $3\times
10^{11} GeV$. Weak interactions remain perturbative despite the large mass
hierarchy, $m_{LSP}\gg m_Z$, because of the special decoupling properties of
supersymmetry. As a result the model is predictive and we discuss the relevant
cosmological processes for the case of a superheavy neutralino within this
scheme.
