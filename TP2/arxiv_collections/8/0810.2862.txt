We are interested in the large-time behavior of periodic entropy solutions in
$L^\infty$ to anisotropic degenerate parabolic-hyperbolic equations of
second-order. Unlike the pure hyperbolic case, the nonlinear equation is no
longer self-similar invariant and the diffusion term in the equation
significantly affects the large-time behavior of solutions; thus the approach
developed earlier based on the self-similar scaling does not directly apply. In
this paper, we develop another approach for establishing the decay of periodic
solutions for anisotropic degenerate parabolic-hyperbolic equations. The proof
is based on the kinetic formulation of entropy solutions. It involves time
translations and a monotonicity-in-time property of entropy solutions, and
employs the advantages of the precise kinetic equation for the solutions in
order to recognize the role of nonlinearity-diffusivity of the equation.
