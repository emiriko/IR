In the monograph Kounchev, O. I., Multivariate Polysplines. Applications to
Numerical and Wavelet Analysis, Academic Press, San Diego-London, 2001, and in
the paper Kounchev O., Render, H., Cardinal interpolation with polysplines on
annuli, Journal of Approximation Theory 137 (2005) 89--107, we have introduced
and studied a new paradigm for cardinal interpolation which is related to the
theory of multivariate polysplines. In the present paper we show that this is
related to a new sampling paradigm in the multivariate case, whereas we obtain
a Shannon type function $S(x) $ and the following Shannon type formula:
$f(r\theta) =\sum_{j=-\infty}^{\infty}\int_{\QTR{Bbb}{S}^{n-1}}S(e^{-j}r\theta
) f(e^{j}\theta) d\theta .$ This formula relies upon infinitely many Shannon
type formulas for the exponential splines arising from the radial part of the
polyharmonic operator $\Delta ^{p}$ for fixed $p\geq 1$. Acknowledgement. The
