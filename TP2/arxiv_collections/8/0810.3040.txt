This work presents measurements of electron-positron pairs from p+p
collisions at sqrt(s) = 200 GeV collected during the 2005 RHIC run and compares
them to results from Au+Au collisions at sqrt(s_NN) = 200 GeV taken in 2004
with the PHENIX detector. The invariant mass distribution of e+e- pairs in p+p
is consistent with the expected contributions from Dalitz decays of light
hadrons, dielectron decays of vector mesons and correlated charm production,
which have been measured in the same experiment. The charm and bottom cross
section extracted from the measured dielectron yield are sigma_cc = 544 +/-
39(stat.) +/- 142(syst.) +/- 200(model) microbarns and sigma_bb = 3.9 +/-
2.4(stat.) +3/-2(syst.) microbarns, respectively.
  In min. bias Au+Au collisions the yield of dielectrons in the low mass region
is enhanced by a factor of 4.0 +/- 0.3(stat.) +/- 1.5(syst.) +/- 0.8(model)
compared to the known hadronic sources. The excess dominates the yield in the
transverse momentum region below 1 GeV/c and shows significantly lower average
p_T than the expected sources. The low p_T enhancement is currently not
understood by any theoretical model of heavy ion collisions. The enhancement
extends to larger transverse momenta where it is also observed in p+p and
explained by virtual direct photons. The p+p measurement serves as an important
test to pQCD calculations of direct photon production from hard scattering
processes in this momentum range. An excess with an inverse slope of T_eff =
221 +/- 23(stat.) +/- 18(syst.) MeV is observed in central Au+Au collisions
above the binary scaled direct photon yield in p+p. This can be qualitatively
explained by hydrodynamical models including thermal photon radiation with
initial temperatures of 300 - 600 MeV and formation times of 0.12 - 0.6 fm/c.
