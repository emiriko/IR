We numerically investigate the vibrational spectra of single-component
clusters in two-dimensions. Stable configurations of clusters at local energy
minima are obtained, and for each the hessian matrix is evaluated and
diagonalized to obtain eigenvalues as well as eigenvectors. We study the
density of states so obtained as a function of the width of the potential well
describing the two-body interaction. As the width is reduced, as in three
dimensions, we find that the density of states approaches a common form, but
the two-peak behavior survives. Further, calculations of the participation
ratio show that most states are extended, although a smaller fraction of the
degrees of freedom are involved in these modes, compared to three dimensions.
We show that the fluctuation properties of these modes converges to those of
the Gaussian orthogonal ensemble of random matrices, in common with previous
results on three dimensional amorphous clusters and molecular liquids
