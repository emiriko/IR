Rolling lubrication with spherical molecules working as 'nanobearings' has
failed experimentally so far, without a full understanding of the physics
involved and of the reasons why. Past model simulations and common sense have
shown that molecules can only roll when they are not too closely packed to jam.
The same type of model simulations now shows in addition that molecular rolling
friction can develop deep minima once the molecule's peripheral 'pitch' can
match the substrate periodicity, much as ordinary cogwheels do in a
rack-and-pinion system. When the pinion-rack matching is bad, the driven
molecular rolling becomes discontinuous and noisy, whence energy is dissipated
and friction is large. This suggests experiments to be conducted by varying the
rack-and-pinion matching. That could be pursued not only by changing molecules
and substrates, but also by applying different sliding directions within the
same system, or by applying pressure, to change the effective matching.
