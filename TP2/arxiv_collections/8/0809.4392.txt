This paper studies the sedimentation-consolidation of a double porosity
material, such as lumpy clay. Large displacements and finite strains are
accounted for in a multidimensional setting. Fundamental equations are derived
using a phenomenological approach and non-equilibrium thermodynamics, as set
out by Coussy [Coussy, Poromechanics, Wiley, Chichester, 2004]. These equations
particularise to three non-linear partial differential equations in one
dimensional context. Numerical implementation in a finite element code is
currently being undertaken.
