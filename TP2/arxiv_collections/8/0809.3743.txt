We summarize the present phenomenology of Sivers and Collins effects for
transverse single spin asymmetries in polarized proton-proton collisions within
the framework of the generalized parton model (GPM). We will discuss a
reassessment of the Collins effect and some preliminary predictions for SSA's
in p(pol) p -> pi,K + X processes at RHIC obtained using updated information
from SIDIS data and a new set of meson fragmentation functions.
