We present fluid dynamics videos of the motion of a boat on a two-layer or
three-layer fluid. Under certain specific conditions, this setup generates
large amplitude interfacial waves, while no surface waves are visible. The boat
is slowed down leading to a peristaltic effect and sometimes even stopped: this
is the so-called dead water phenomenon.
