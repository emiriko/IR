We present a new construction of non-classical unitals from a classical
unital $U$ in $PG(2,q^2)$. The resulting non-classical unitals are B-M unitals.
The idea is to find a non-standard model $\Pi$ of $PG(2,q^2)$ with the
following three properties: 1. points of $\Pi$ are those of $PG(2,q^2)$; 2.
lines of $\Pi$ are certain lines and conics of $PG(2,q^2)$; 3. the points in
$U$ form a non-classical B-M unital in $\Pi$.
  Our construction also works for the B-T unital, provided that conics are
replaced by certain algebraic curves of higher degree.
