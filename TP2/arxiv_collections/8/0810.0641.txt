Investigations of the Fermi surface via the electron momentum distribution
reconstructed from either angular correlation of annihilation radiation (or
Compton scattering) experimental spectra are presented. The basis of these
experiments and mathematical methods applied in reconstructing
three-dimensional densities from line (or plane) projections measured in these
experiments are described. The review of papers where such techniques have been
applied to study the Fermi surface of metallic materials with showing their
main results is also done.
