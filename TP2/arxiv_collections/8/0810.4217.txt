Restricted Schur polynomials have been posited as orthonormal operators for
the change of basis from N=4 SYM to type IIB string theory [1,2,3,4]. In this
letter we briefly expound the relationship found between the restricted Schurs
and the operators found by Brown, Heslop and Ramgoolam in [5]. We then briefly
examine the finite N counting of the restricted Schur polynomials.
