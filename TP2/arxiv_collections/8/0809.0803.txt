In this work PIXE experiments were performed for measuring heavy and light
elements (ranging from aluminium to lead) concentrations inside various
polluted and unpolluted soils as well as liquid samples collected from
different phosphate factory sewers in the El Jadida-Safi Atlantic coastal
region (Morocco). In addition, uranium (238U) and thorium (232Th) contents were
evaluated in the same samples studied by using CR-39 and LR-115 type II solid
state nuclear track detectors (SSNTDs). The influence of the phosphate industry
wastes on the concentrations of both radioactive and non-radioactive elements
of the samples studied was investigated.
