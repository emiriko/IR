In this paper considering quantum heat transport equation (QHT) formulated in
our earlier papers the temperature for universes with G < 0 is calculated. As
the solution of complex QHT (Schrodinger type equation), the temperature is
complex also. We argue that due to anthropic limitation of the observer
ImT(r,t)=0 From this condition the discretization of space-time radius R,
velocity of the universe expansion v, Hubble parameter H and acceleration of
the expansion a are calculated. The agreement with observational data for our
Universe is quite good. PACS 98.62.Py PACS 98.80.Bp PACS 98.80.Cq
