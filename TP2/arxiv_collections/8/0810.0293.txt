Extensively applied to both light and heavy meson decay and standing as one
of the most successful strong decay models is the $3^P_0$ model, in which
$q\bar{q}$ pair production is the dominant mechanism. The pair production can
be obtained from the non-relativistic limit of a microscopic interaction
Hamiltonian involving Dirac quark fields. The evaluation of the decay amplitude
can be performed by a diagrammatic technique for drawing quark lines. In this
paper we use an alternative approach which consists in a mapping technique, the
Fock-Tani formalism, in order to obtain an effective Hamiltonian starting from
same microscopic interaction. An additional effect is manifest in this
formalism associated to the extended nature of mesons: bound-state corrections.
A corrected $3^P_0$ is obtained and applied, as an example, to
$b_{1}\to\omega\pi$ and $a_{1}\to\rho\pi$ decays.
