It is stated in the main in essence new approach to mechanics of the stressed
state of the solid body from statistically isotropic material and the
homogeneous liquid dynamics. The approach essence is in the detected property
of the core-shell spontaneous structurization of internal energy of the solid
and liquid bodies in its natural state and under action of external forces. The
method elements of construction of physically adequate model of the stressed
state of the solid and liquid bodies, reproduced exactly its behavior on the
stages of elastic and plastic deformation, flow and fracture, are stated. It is
adduced a number of the examples of the stressed state construction of the
simple form bodies under action of its tension, compression, torsion and at its
contact interaction. For the first time it is adduced structure of the
principal - normal - stresses in cylindrical bar under action of the torsion
moment. The detected property and the developed method is one of necessary
bases for construction of physically adequate mathematical model of the
stressed state of the body and fluid in contrast to traditional approach.
