Given a brane tiling, that is a bipartite graph on a torus, we can associate
with it a quiver potential and a quiver potential algebra. Under certain
consistency conditions on a brane tiling, we prove a formula for the
Donaldson-Thomas type invariants of the moduli space of framed cyclic modules
over the corresponding quiver potential algebra. We relate this formula with
the counting of perfect matchings of the periodic plane tiling corresponding to
the brane tiling. We prove that the same consistency conditions imply that the
quiver potential algebra is a 3-Calabi-Yau algebra. We also formulate a
rationality conjecture for the generating functions of the Donaldson-Thomas
type invariants.
