We show that every minimal action of any finitely generated abelian group on
the Cantor set is (topologically) orbit equivalent to an AF relation. As a
consequence, this extends the classification up to orbit equivalence of minimal
dynamical systems on the Cantor set to include AF relations and Z^d-actions.
