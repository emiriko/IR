The NA48/2 collaboration has shown clear experimental evidence for a cusp in
the data for K -> pi pi^0 pi^0. This effect can be used to extract information
on the pi-pi scattering lengths. We address this issue using a two-loop
dispersive construction of pi pi -> pi pi and K -> pi pi pi amplitudes in the
presence of isospin breaking.
