Based on an optical analogy of spintronics, the generation of optical
tornadoes is theoretically investigated in two-dimensional photonic crystals
without space-inversion symmetry. We address its close relation to the Berry
curvature in crystal momentum space, which represents the non-trivial geometric
property of a Bloch state. It is shown that the Berry curvature is easily
controlled by tuning two types of dielectric rods in a honeycomb photonic
crystal. Then, Bloch states with large Berry curvatures appear as optical
tornadoes in real space. The radiation force of such a configuration is
analyzed, and its possible application is also discussed.
