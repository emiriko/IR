I present latest measurements from the B factories of branching fractions for
B meson decays to hadronic two- and three-body final states. These include the
rate of doubly Cabibbo-suppressed charge states of charmed mesons in two-body
decays, charmed baryons and other structure seen in baryonic B decays, and
charmless mesonic two-body decays in comparison with estimates from theory.
