Volumes of sub-wavelength electromagnetic elements can act like homogeneous
materials: metamaterials. In analogy, sheets of optical elements such as prisms
can act ray-optically like homogeneous sheet materials. In this sense, such
sheets can be considered to be metamaterials for light rays (METATOYs).
METATOYs realize new and unusual transformations of the directions of
transmitted light rays. We study here, in the ray-optics and scalar-wave
limits, the wave-optical analog of such transformations, and we show that such
an analog does not always exist. Perhaps, this is the reason why many of the
ray-optical possibilities offered by METATOYs have never before been
considered.
