We present a method of discrete modeling and analysis of multilevel dynamics
of complex large-scale hierarchical dynamic systems subject to external dynamic
control mechanism. Architectural model of information system supporting
simulation and analysis of dynamic processes and development scenarios
(strategies) of complex large-scale hierarchical systems is also proposed.
