(00l)-Oriented LiNbO3 ultra-thin film was fabricated on Pt/Ti/SiO2/Si
substrate using pulsed laser deposition. The film shrunk into crystalline state
nanoparticles that still kept (00l) preferential orientation as being annealed
in the oxygen atmosphere at 500 oC for 2 hours. These LiNbO3 nanoparticles
exhibited the ferroelectricity, showing asymmetrical hysteresis loop which
might originate from the large internal field at the interface. These
nanoparticles could be used for further studying on the size effects and the
ferroelectricity of nanocrystal.
