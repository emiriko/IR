This paper presents a new rate based call gapping method. The main advantage
is that it provides maximal throughput, priority handling and fairness for
traffic classes without queues, unlike Token Bucket which provides only the
first two or Weighted Fair Queuing that uses queues. The Token Bucket is used
for call gapping because it has good throughput characteristics. For this
reason we present a mixture of the two methods keeping the good properties of
both. A mathematical model has been developed to support our proposal. It
defines the three requirements and proves theorems about if they are satisfied
with the different call gapping mechanisms. Simulation, numerical results and
statistical discussion are also presented to underpin the findings.
