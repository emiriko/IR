The magnetic ground state phase diagram of the disordered Hubbard model at
half-filling is computed in dynamical mean-field theory supplemented with the
spin resolved, typical local density of states. The competition between
many-body correlations and disorder is found to stabilize paramagnetic and
antiferromagnetic metallic phases at weak interactions. Strong disorder leads
to Anderson localization of the electrons and suppresses the antiferromagnetic
long-range order. Slater and Heisenberg antiferromagnets respond
characteristically different to disorder. The results can be tested with cold
fermionic atoms loaded into optical lattices.
