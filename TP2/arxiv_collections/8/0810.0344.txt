These third-year lecture notes are designed for a 1-semester course in
topological quantum field theory (TQFT). Assumed background in mathematics and
physics are only standard second-year subjects: multivariable calculus,
introduction to quantum mechanics and basic electromagnetism.
  Keywords: quantum mechanics/field theory, path integral, Hodge decomposition,
Chern-Simons and Yang-Mills gauge theories, conformal field theory
