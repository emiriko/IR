In both Supersymmetry and in generic Two Higgs Doublet models (2HDM), the
charged Higgs boson $H^+- exhibits a unique phenomenological signature. We
report on a search for charged Higgs bosons, performed using 0.9 fb^-1 of data
collected with the D0 detector at the Fermilab Tevatron ppbar collider with a
center-of-mass energy of \sqrt{s}=1.96 TeV. No evidence for a charged Higgs
boson is found and we set limits on its production cross section or the
branching fraction.
