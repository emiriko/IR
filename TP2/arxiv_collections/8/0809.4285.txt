We show that a difference in time scales of vertical and lateral dynamics
permits one to analyze the problem of interacting electrons confined in an
axially symmetric three-dimensional potential with a lateral oscillator
confinement by means of the effective two-dimensional Hamiltonian with a
screened Coulomb interaction. Using an adiabatic approximation based on
action-angle variables, we present solutions for the effective charge of the
Coulomb interaction (screening) for a vertical confinement potential simulated
by parabolic, square, and triangular wells. While for the parabolic potential
the solution for the effective charge is given in a closed anlytical form, for
the other cases similar solutions can be easily calculated numerically.
