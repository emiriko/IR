From the Fractional Quantum Hall Effect States on a torus with filling factor
nu = 1/p, p odd, we found that for small values of nu such states describe
triangular Wigner crystals which are stable configurations. Therefore, the
insulator phase of the two-dimensional electron system can be described with
the same wave function that the liquid phase, and the incompressible liquid
freezes (or the Wigner crystal melts) without any quantum transition between
states, thus the system phase changes by means of a direct transition. We found
at least one stable configuration of a Wigner crystal with F = 3 electrons for
cell and we investigate the behavior of the crystal when the lengths ratio
Ly/Lx changes.
