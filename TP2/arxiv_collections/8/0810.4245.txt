We briefly summarize the status with electromagnetic nucleon form factors,
and give in this framework, arguments to study the angular dependence of the
differential cross section and single-spin polarization phenomena (polarized
target or polarized beam) in $\bar{p}+{p}\to \ell^++\ell^-$, in view of the
availability of future antiproton beams.
