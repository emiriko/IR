We suggest that superconductivity (SC) in the organic charge transfer solids
(CTS) is reached from a Bond-Charge Density Wave (BCDW). We discuss an
effective model for the BCDW to SC transition, an attractive U extended Hubbard
Hamiltonian with repulsive nearest neighbor interaction V. We discuss
experimental consequences of the theory for different classes of CTS
superconductors as well as related inorganic materials.
