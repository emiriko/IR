We study the chemisorption of CO molecule into sites of different
coordination on (111) surfaces of late 4d and 5d transition metals. In an
attempt to solve the well-known CO adsorption puzzle we have applied the
relatively new vdW-DF theory of nonlocal correlation. The application of the
vdW-DF functional in all considered cases improves or completely solves the
discrepancies of the adsorption site preference and improves the value of the
adsorption energy. By introducing a cutoff distance for nonlocal interaction we
pinpoint the length scale at which the correlation plays a major role in the
systems considered.
