The problem of the molecular diffusion in a biphasic fluid mixture is studied
here from the two complementary points of view of Continuum Mechanics - in a
somewhat different manner from Truesdell in "Mechanical basis of diffusion" (J.
Chem. Physics (U.S.), 37 (1962) 2336-2344) - and that of Thermodynamics. It is
established that the force involved in the 'diffusive drag', i.e. in the
inter-constituent viscous friction, is necessarily linked to the relative
diffusion velocity of one constituent with respect to the other. We also end up
with Fick's first law, which appears to be a sufficient condition for the
dissipated power associated with the diffusive motions to be positive.
