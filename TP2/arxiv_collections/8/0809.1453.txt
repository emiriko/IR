We study the ferroelectric stability and surface structural properties of an
oxygen-terminated hexagonal YMnO$_3$ ultra-thin film using density functional
theory. Under an open circuit boundary condition, the ferroelectric state with
the spontaneous polarization normal to the (0001) surface, is found to be
metastable in a single domain state despite the presence of a depolarizing
field. We establish a connection between the result and the role of improper
ferroelectric transition. Our results imply that improper ferroelectric
ultrathin films can have rather unique properties that are distinctive from
those of very thin films of ordinary ferroelectrics.
