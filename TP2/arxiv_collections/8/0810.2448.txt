The pion-baryon sigma terms and the strange-quark condensates of the octet
and the decuplet baryons are calculated by employing the method of quantum
chromodynamics (QCD) sum rules. We evaluate the vacuum-to-vacuum transition
matrix elements of two baryon interpolating fields in an external
isoscalar-scalar field and use a Monte Carlo-based approach to systematically
analyze the sum rules and the uncertainties in the results. We extract the
ratios of the sigma terms, which have rather high accuracy and minimal
dependence on QCD parameters. We discuss the sources of uncertainties and
comment on possible strangeness content of the nucleon and the Delta.
