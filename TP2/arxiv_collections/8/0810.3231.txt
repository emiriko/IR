This review briefly outlines recent experimental results from the charmonium
system. These include new measurements of the M1 radiative transition rates
$B(\psi(1S,2S)\to\gamma\eta_c(1S))$; new insights into the mass of the
$\eta_c(1S)$; the observation of $J/\psi(1S)$ decays to three photons; new
measurements of the two-photon widths of the $\chi_{cJ}(1P)$; the observation
of radiative decays of the $\chi_{cj}(1P)$ to light quarks; a precise
measurement of the $h_c(1P)$ mass; and an update on properties of the
$\eta_c(2S)$. Each result adds piecemeal to our understanding of the strong
force.
