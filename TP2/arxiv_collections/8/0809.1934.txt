We present a security analysis of the recently introduced Quantum Private
Query (QPQ) protocol. It is a cheat sensitive quantum protocol to perform a
private search on a classical database. It allows a user to retrieve an item
from the database without revealing which item was retrieved, and at the same
time it ensures data privacy of the database (the information that the user can
retrieve in a query is bounded and does not depend on the size of the
database). The security analysis is based on information-disturbance tradeoffs
which show that whenever the provider tries to obtain information on the query,
the query (encoded into a quantum system) is disturbed so that the person
querying the database can detect the privacy violation.
