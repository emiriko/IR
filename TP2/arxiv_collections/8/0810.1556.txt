The study of quantum walk processes has been widely divided into two standard
variants, the discrete-time quantum walk (DTQW) and the continuous-time quantum
walk (CTQW). The connection between the two variants has been established by
considering the limiting value of the coin operation parameter in the DTQW, and
the coin degree of freedom was shown to be unnecessary [26]. But the coin
degree of freedom is an additional resource which can be exploited to control
the dynamics of the QW process. In this paper we present a generic quantum walk
model using a quantum coin-embedded unitary shift operation $U_{C}$. The
standard version of the DTQW and the CTQW can be conveniently retrieved from
this generic model, retaining the features of the coin degree of freedom in
both variants.
