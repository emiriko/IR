We solve the Periodic Anderson model in the Mott-Hubbard regime, using
Dynamical Mean Field Theory. Upon electron doping of the Mott insulator, a
metal-insulator transition occurs which is qualitatively similar to that of the
single band Hubbard model, namely with a divergent effective mass and a first
order character at finite temperatures. Surprisingly, upon hole doping, the
metal-insulator transition is not first order and does not show a divergent
mass. Thus, the transition scenario of the single band Hubbard model is not
generic for the Periodic Anderson model, even in the Mott-Hubbard regime.
