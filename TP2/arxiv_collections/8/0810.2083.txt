We derive a lattice $\beta$-function for the 2d-Antiferromagnetic Heisenberg
model, which allows the lattice interaction couplings of the nonperturbative
Quantum Monte Carlo vacuum to be related directly to the zero-temperature fixed
points of the nonlinear sigma model in the presence of strong interplanar and
spin anisotropies. In addition to the usual renormalization of the gapful
disordered state in the vicinity of the quantum critical point, we show that
this leads to a chiral doubling of the spectra of excited states.
