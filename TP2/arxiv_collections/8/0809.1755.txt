Hole-doping of NdFeAsO via partial replacement of Nd3+ by Sr2+ is a
successful route to obtain superconducting phases (Tc = 13.5 K for a Sr2+
content of 20%); however, the structural and electronic response with doping is
different from and non-symmetric to that in the electron-doped side of the
phase diagram.
