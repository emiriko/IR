Recently much attention has been paid to quantum circuit design to prepare
for the future "quantum computation era." Like the conventional logic
synthesis, it should be important to verify and analyze the functionalities of
generated quantum circuits. For that purpose, we propose an efficient
verification method for quantum circuits under a practical restriction. Thanks
to the restriction, we can introduce an efficient verification scheme based on
decision diagrams called
  Decision Diagrams for Matrix Functions (DDMFs). Then, we show analytically
the advantages of our approach based on DDMFs over the previous verification
techniques. In order to introduce DDMFs, we also introduce new concepts,
quantum functions and matrix functions, which may also be interesting and
useful on their own for designing quantum circuits.
