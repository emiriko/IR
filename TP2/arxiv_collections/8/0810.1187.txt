This paper studies the frequency/time selective $K$-user Gaussian
interference channel with secrecy constraints. Two distinct models, namely the
interference channel with confidential messages and the one with an external
eavesdropper, are analyzed. The key difference between the two models is the
lack of channel state information (CSI) about the external eavesdropper. Using
interference alignment along with secrecy pre-coding, it is shown that each
user can achieve non-zero secure Degrees of Freedom (DoF) for both cases. More
precisely, the proposed coding scheme achieves $\frac{K-2}{2K-2}$ secure DoF
{\em with probability one} per user in the confidential messages model. For the
external eavesdropper scenario, on the other hand, it is shown that each user
can achieve $\frac{K-2}{2K}$ secure DoF {\em in the ergodic setting}.
Remarkably, these results establish the {\em positive impact} of interference
on the secrecy capacity region of wireless networks.
