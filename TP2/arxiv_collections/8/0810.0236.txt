Clusters containing a single magnetic impurity were investigated by scanning
tunneling microscopy, spectroscopy, and ab initio electronic structure
calculations. The Kondo temperature of a Co atom embedded in Cu clusters on
Cu(111) exhibits a non-monotonic variation with the cluster size. Calculations
model the experimental observations and demonstrate the importance of the local
and anisotropic electronic structure for correlation effects in small clusters.
