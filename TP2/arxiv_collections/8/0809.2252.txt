The unconditional security of continuous-variable quantum key distribution is
established for all schemes based on the estimation of the channel loss and
excess noise. It is proved that, in the limit of large keys, Gaussian attacks
are asymptotically optimal among the most general (coherent) attacks, where the
transmission is tapped using arbitrary ancillas and stored in a quantum memory
as a whole. Then, it is shown that the previously derived bounds on the
achievable secret key rates against collective attacks remain asymptotically
valid for arbitrary coherent attacks.
