We analyze the discovery potential of the next-to-minimal supergravity
motivated model: NmSuGra. This model is an extension of mSuGra by a gauge
singlet, and contains only one additional parameter: lambda, the
Higgs-singlet-Higgs coupling. NmSuGra solves the mu-problem and reduces the
fine tuning of mSuGra.
  After identifying parameter space regions preferred by present experimental
data, we show that these regions of NmSuGra are amenable to detection by the
combination of the Large Hadron Collider and an upgraded Cryogenic Dark Matter
Search.
  This conclusion holds strictly provided that the more than three sigma
discrepancy in the difference of the experimental and the standard theoretical
values of the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon prevails in the future.
