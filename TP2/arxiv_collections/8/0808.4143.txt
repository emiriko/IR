We experimentally investigate the role of localization on the adiabaticity of
loading a Bose-Einstein condensate into a one-dimensional optical potential
comprised of a shallow primary lattice plus one or two perturbing lattice(s) of
incommensurate period. We find that even a very weak perturbation causes
dramatic changes in the momentum distribution and makes adiabatic loading of
the combined lattice much more difficult than for a single period lattice. We
interpret our results using a band structure model and the one-dimensional
Gross-Pitaevskii equation.
