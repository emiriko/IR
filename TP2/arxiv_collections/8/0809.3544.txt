We show that the K_{2i}(Z[x]/(x^m),(x)) is finite of order (mi)!(i!)^{m-2}
and that K_{2i+1}(Z[x]/(x^m),(x)) is free abelian of rank m-1. This is
accomplished by showing that the equivariant homotopy groups of the topological
Hochschild spectrum THH(Z) are finite, in odd degrees, and free abelian, in
even degrees, and by evaluating their orders and ranks, respectively.
