It is shown that the before-before (or Suarez-Scarani) experiment refutes
hidden variable models with a deterministic ("realistic") nonlocal part, and
the experimental violation of Leggett-type inequalities models with a random
nonlocal part and a biased random local one. Therefore the claim that
Groeblacher et al. present "an experimental test of nonlocal realism" [Nature,
446, 871-875 (2007)] is misleading, and Marek Zukowski's comment
[arXiv:0809.0072v1] misses the point. A new experiment is proposed.
