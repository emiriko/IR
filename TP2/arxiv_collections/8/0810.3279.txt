In this paper we consider central limit theorems for various macroscopic
observables in the high temperature region of the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick spin
glass model. With a particular focus on obtaining a quenched central limit
theorem for the energy density of the system with non-zero external field, we
show how to combine the mean field cavity method with Stein's method in the
quenched regime. The result for the energy density extends the corresponding
result of Comets-Neveu.
