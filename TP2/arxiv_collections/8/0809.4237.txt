A unified theory for the cuprates and the iron-based superconductors is
derived on the basis of common features in their electronic structures
including quasi-two-dimensionality, and the large-U nature of the electron
orbitals close to E_F (smaller-U hybridized orbitals reside at bonding and
antibonding states away from E_F). Consequently, low-energy excitations are
described in terms of auxiliary particles, representing combinations of
atomic-like electron configurations, rather than electron-like quasiparticles.
The introduction of a Lagrange Bose field is necessary to enable the treatments
of these auxiliary particles as bosons or fermions. The condensation of the
bosons results in static or dynamical inhomogeneities, and consequently in a
commensurate or an incommensurate resonance mode. The dynamics of the fermions
determines the charge transport, and their strong coupling to the
Lagrange-field bosons results in pairing and superconductivity. The calculated
resonance mode in hole-doped cuprates agrees with the experimental results, and
is shown to be correlated with the pairing gap on the Fermi arcs.
