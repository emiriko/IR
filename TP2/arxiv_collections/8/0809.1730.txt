We calculate the real-time-correlation function of the
Sherrington-Kirkpatrick spin-glass model in a transverse field. Using a careful
analysis of the perturbative expansion of the functional-integral
representation, we derive the asymptotic form of the correlation function. In
contrast to the previous works, we find for large transverse field a power-law
decay of the correlation with time $t$ as $t^{-3/2}$ at zero temperature and
$t^{-2}$ at infinite temperature. At the small field region, we also find a
significant change in the correlation which comes from the structural
difference between two paramagnetic phases.
