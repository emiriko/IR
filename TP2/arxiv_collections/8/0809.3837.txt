In \cite{bf} Br\'ezis and Friedman prove that certain nonlinear parabolic
equations, with the $\delta$-measure as initial data, have no solution. However
in \cite{cl} Colombeau and Langlais prove that these equations have a unique
solution even if the $\delta$-measure is substituted by any Colombeau
generalized function of compact support. Here we generalize Colombeau and
Langlais their result proving that we may take any generalized function as the
initial data. Our approach relies on resent algebraic and topological
developments of the theory of Colombeau generalized functions and results from
\cite{A}.
