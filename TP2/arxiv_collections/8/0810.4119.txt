In many real-world networks, the rates of node and link addition are time
dependent. This observation motivates the definition of accelerating networks.
There has been relatively little investigation of accelerating networks and
previous efforts at analyzing their degree distributions have employed
mean-field techniques. By contrast, we show that it is possible to apply a
master-equation approach to such network development. We provide full
time-dependent expressions for the evolution of the degree distributions for
the canonical situations of random and preferential attachment in networks
undergoing constant acceleration. These results are in excellent agreement with
results obtained from simulations. We note that a growing, non-equilibrium
network undergoing constant acceleration with random attachment is equivalent
to a classical random graph, bridging the gap between non-equilibrium and
classical equilibrium networks.
