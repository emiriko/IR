The electronic chip industry embodies the height of technological
sophistication and economics of scale. Fabricating inexpensive photonic
components by leveraging this mighty manufacturing infrastructure has fueled
intense interest in silicon photonics. If it can be done economically and in an
energy efficient manner, empowering silicon with optical functionality will
bring optical communications to the realm of computers where limitations of
metallic interconnects are threatening the industry's future. The field is
making stunning progress and stands to have a bright future, as long as the
community recognizes the real challenges, and maintains an open mind with
respect to its applications. This talk will review recent 'game changing'
developments and discuss promising applications beyond data communication. It
will conclude with recent observation of extreme-value statistical behavior in
silicon photonics, a powerful example of how scientific discoveries can
unexpectedly emerge in the course of technology development.
