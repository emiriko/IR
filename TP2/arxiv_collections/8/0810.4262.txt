We consider the initial value problem and its renormalisation in the
framework of the two-particle-irreducible (2PI) effective action. We argue that
in the case of appropriately chosen self-consistent initial conditions, the
counterterms needed to renormalise the system in equilibrium are also
sufficient to renormalise its time evolution. In this way we improve on
Gaussian initial conditions which have the disadvantage of generically not
showing a continuum limit. For a more detailed discussion see arXiv:0809.0496.
