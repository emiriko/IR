The generalization of the simplest equation method to look for exact
solutions of systems of nonlinear differential equations is presented. The
exact solutions of NDE systems describing the evolution of two interacting
populations in two cases (both populations have the low critical density or low
critical density is typical for only one of populations) are obtained.
