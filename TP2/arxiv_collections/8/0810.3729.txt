We improve the upper bound of Levenshtein for the cardinality of a code of
length 4 capable of correcting single deletions over an alphabet of even size.
We also illustrate that the new upper bound is sharp. Furthermore we will
construct an optimal perfect code capable of correcting single deletions for
the same parameters.
