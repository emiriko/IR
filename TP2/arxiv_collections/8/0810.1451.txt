We present a simulation to characterize the dependence on hydrostatic
pressure for the photoluminescence spectra in self-assembled quantum dots with
lens shape geometry. We have tested the physical effects of the band offset and
electron-hole effective masses on the optical emission in dot lens. The model
could be implemented to get qualitative information of the parameters involved
in the quantum dot or the measured optical properties as function of pressure.
