The $\pi$-electronic structure of graphene in the presence of a modulated
electric potential is investigated by the tight-binding model. The low-energy
electronic properties are strongly affected by the period and field strength.
Such a field could modify the energy dispersions, destroy state degeneracy, and
induce band-edge states. It should be noted that a modulated electric potential
could make semiconducting graphene semimetallic, and that the onset period of
such a transition relies on the field strength. There exist infinite
Fermi-momentum states in sharply contrast with two crossing points (Dirac
points) for graphene without external fields. The finite density of states
(DOS) at the Fermi level means that there are free carriers, and, at the same
time, the low DOS spectrum exhibits many prominent peaks, mainly owing to the
band-edge states.
