Using the highly inhomogeneous fields of a magnetic substrate, tunable
junctions between superconducting and normal state regions were created inside
a thin film superconductor. The investigation of these junctions, created in
the same material, gave evidence for the occurrence of Andreev reflection,
indicating the high transparency of interfaces between superconducting and
normal state regions. For the realization of this study, a ferromagnet with
magnetic stripe domains was used as a substrate, on top of which a
superconducting transport bridge was prepared perpendicular to the underlying
domains. The particular choice of materials allowed to restrict the nucleation
of superconductivity to regions above either reverse-domains or domain walls.
Moreover, due to the specific design of the sample, transport currents in the
superconductor passed through a sequence of normal and superconducting regions.
