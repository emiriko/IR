The bound state extension of Skyrme's topological soliton model for the heavy
baryons is quantized canonically in arbitrary reducible representations of the
SU(3) flavor group. The canonical quantization leads to an additional negative
mass term, which stabilizes the quantized soliton solution. The heavy flavor
meson in the field of the soliton is treated with semiclassical quantization.
The representation dependence of the calculated spectra for the strange, charm
and bottom baryons is explored and compared to the extant empirical spectra.
