Wave-packet interference is investigated within the complex quantum
Hamilton-Jacobi formalism using a hydrodynamic description. Quantum
interference leads to the formation of the topological structure of quantum
caves in space-time Argand plots. These caves consist of the vortical and
stagnation tubes originating from the isosurfaces of the amplitude of the wave
function and its first derivative. Complex quantum trajectories display
counterclockwise helical wrapping around the stagnation tubes and hyperbolic
deflection near the vortical tubes. The string of alternating stagnation and
vortical tubes is sufficient to generate divergent trajectories. Moreover, the
average wrapping time for trajectories and the rotational rate of the nodal
line in the complex plane can be used to define the lifetime for interference
features.
