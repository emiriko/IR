The SciBooNE experiment is designed to measure neutrino cross sections on
carbon around one GeV region. Charged current single charged pion production is
a dominant background process for $\nu_\mu \to \nu_x$ oscillation experiments
with a few-GeV neutrino beam, and thus a precision measurement of the cross
section is essential. This article reports preliminary results on this process
from SciBooNE.
