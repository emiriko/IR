We identify two "universality" classes in the Coulomb frustrated phase
separation phenomenon. They correspond to two different kind of electronic
compressibility anomalies often encountered in strongly correlated electronic
systems. We discuss differences and similarities of their corresponding phase
diagrams in two- and three-dimensional systems.
