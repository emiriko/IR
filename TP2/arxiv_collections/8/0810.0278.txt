Theoretical study of dynamical phenomena induced by a linearly polarized
plane wave incident perpendicularly on a planar aligned nematic layer with the
light intensity as the control parameter is reported. We find the threshold of
the Optically Induced Freedericksz Transition for the planar state as a
function of the problem parameters. It occurs that the threshold is
substantially lower than that expected before. Above the primary instability
the director settles either to a stationary or to an oscillatory states
depending on a thickness of the layer. These states become unstable at a
secondary threshold through a heteroclinic bifurcation and the director settles
to a new stationary distorted state.
