We explain the isomorphism between the $G$-Hilbert scheme and the F-blowup
from the noncommutative viewpoint after Van den Bergh. In doing this, we
immediately and naturally arrive at the notion of $D$-modules. We also find, as
a byproduct, a canonical way to construct a noncommutative resolution at least
for a few classes of singularities in positive characteristic.
