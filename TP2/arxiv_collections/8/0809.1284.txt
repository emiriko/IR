The braneworld description of our universe entails a large extra dimension
and a fundamental scale of gravity that might be lower by several orders of
magnitude as compared to the Planck scale. An interesting consequence of the
braneworld scenario is in the nature of the vacuum solutions of the brane
gravitational field equations, with properties quite distinct as compared to
the standard black hole solutions of general relativity. One possibility of
observationally discriminating between different types of black holes is the
study of the emission properties of the accretion disks. In the present paper
we obtain the energy flux, the emission spectrum and accretion efficiency from
the accretion disks around several classes of static and rotating brane world
black holes, and we compare them to the general relativistic case. Particular
signatures can appear in the electromagnetic spectrum, thus leading to the
possibility of directly testing extra-dimensional physical models by using
astrophysical observations of the emission spectra from accretion disks.
