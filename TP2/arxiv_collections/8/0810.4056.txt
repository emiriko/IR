We have performed a first-principles density functional theory investigation
of the penetration of helium atoms through a graphene monolayer with defects.
The relaxation of the graphene layer caused by the incoming helium atoms does
not have a strong influence on the height of the energy barriers for
penetration. For defective graphene layers, the penetration barriers decrease
exponentially with the size of the defects but they are still sufficiently high
that very large defects are needed to make the graphene sheet permeable for
small atoms and molecules. This makes graphene a very promising material for
the construction of nanocages and nanomembranes.
