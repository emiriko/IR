We consider the spectral and dynamical properties of quantum systems of $n$
particles on the lattice $\Z^d$, of arbitrary dimension, with a Hamiltonian
which in addition to the kinetic term includes a random potential with iid
values at the lattice sites and a finite-range interaction. Two basic
parameters of the model are the strength of the disorder and the strength of
the interparticle interaction. It is established here that for all $n$ there
are regimes of high disorder, and/or weak enough interactions, for which the
system exhibits spectral and dynamical localization. The localization is
expressed through bounds on the transition amplitudes, which are uniform in
time and decay exponentially in the Hausdorff distance in the configuration
space. The results are derived through the analysis of fractional moments of
the $n$-particle Green function, and related bounds on the eigenfunction
correlators.
