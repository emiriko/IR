Using the model of interaction between two-level systems (TLS) and strain
fields introduced in Phys. Rev. B 75, 064202 (2007), we calculate the TLS-TLS
interaction. We particularize our calculations to amorphous materials and
analyze the dependence of the interaction Hamiltonian on the orientations of
the two TLSs and of the direction that connects them. Assuming isotropic
distribution of the TLSs orientations, we then averaged the interaction over
one of the TLSs orientations. The resulting interaction depends in a simple way
on the angle between the orientation of the other TLS and the line that
connects the two TLSs.
