We review the formalisms of the self-consistent GW approximation to many-body
perturbation theory and of the generation of optimally-localized Wannier
functions from groups of energy bands. We show that the quasiparticle Bloch
wave functions from such GW calculations can be used within this Wannier
framework. These Wannier functions can be used to interpolate the many-body
band structure from the coarse mesh of Brillouin zone points on which it is
known from the initial calculation to the usual symmetry lines, and we
demonstrate that this procedure is accurate and efficient for the
self-consistent GW band structure. The resemblance of these Wannier functions
to the bond orbitals discussed in the chemical community led us to expect
differences between density-functional and many-body functions that could be
qualitatively interpreted. However, the differences proved to be minimal in the
cases studied. Detailed results are presented for SrTiO_3 and solid argon.
