DNA adsorption on solid or liquid surfaces is a topic of broad fundamental
and applied interest. Here we study by x-ray reflectivity the adsorption of
monodisperse double-stranded DNA molecules a positively-charged surface,
obtained through chemical grafting of a homogeneous organicmonomolecular layer
of N-(2-aminoethyl) dodecanamide on an oxide-free monocrystalline Si(111)
wafer. The adsorbed dsDNA is found to embed into the soft monolayer which is
deformed in the process. The surface coverage is very high and this adsorbed
layer is expected to display 2D nematic ordering.
