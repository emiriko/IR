We show that the scenario of multi-scale Kondo breakdown quantum critical
point (QCP) gives rise to a divergent Gr\"uneisen ratio with an anomalous
exponent 0.7. In particular, we fit the experimental data of
$YbRh_{2}(Si_{0.95}Ge_{0.05})_{2}$ for specific heat, thermal expansion, and
Gr\"uneisen ratio based on our simple analytic expressions. A reasonable
agreement between the experiment and theory is found for the temperature range
between 0.4 K and 10 K. We discuss how the Gr\"uneisen ratio is a key
measurement to discriminate between the Kondo breakdown and spin-density wave
theories.
