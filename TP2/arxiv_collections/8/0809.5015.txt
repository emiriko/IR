The recently introduced orientifold planar equivalence is a promising tool
for solving non-perturbative problems in QCD. One of the predictions of
orientifold planar equivalence is that the chiral condensates of a theory with
$N_f$ flavours of Dirac fermions in the symmetric (or antisymmetric)
representation and $N_f$ flavours of Majorana fermions in the adjoint
representation have the same large $N$ value for any value of the mass of the
(degenerate) fermions. Assuming the invariance of the theory under charge
conjugation, we prove this statement on the lattice for staggered quenched
condensates in SU($N$) Yang-Mills in the large $N$ limit. Then, we compute
numerically those quenched condensates for $N$ up to 8. After separating the
even from the odd corrections in $1/N$, we are able to show that our data
support the equivalence; however, unlike other quenched observables, subleading
terms in $1/N$ are needed for describing the data for the symmetric and
antisymmetric representation at $N$=3. Possible lessons for the unquenched case
are discussed.
