We calculate the differential cross section for real photon electroproduction
off spinless hadron which sevres as a main probe of the hadrons structure via
the concept of generalized parton distributions. Compared to previously
available computations performed with twist-three power accuracy, we exactly
accounted for all kinematical effects in hadron mass and momentum transfer
which arise from leptonic helicity amplitudes. We performed numerical studies
of these kinematical effects and demonstrated that in the valence quark region
and rather low virtualities of the hard photon which sets the factorization
scale, the available approximate results significantly overestimate the cross
section rates in comparison to exact formulas.
