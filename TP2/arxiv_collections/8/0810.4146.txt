We review and compare recent work on the properties of fluctuating interfaces
between nematic and isotropic liquid-crystalline phases. Molecular dynamics and
Monte Carlo simulations have been carried out for systems of ellipsoids and
hard rods with aspect ratio 15:1, and the fluctuation spectrum of interface
positions (the capillary wave spectrum) has been analyzed. In addition, the
capillary wave spectrum has been calculated analytically within the Landau-de
Gennes theory. The theory predicts that the interfacial fluctuations can be
described in terms of a wave vector dependent interfacial tension, which is
anisotropic at small wavelengths (stiff director regime) and becomes isotropic
at large wavelengths (flexible director regime). After determining the elastic
constants in the nematic phase, theory and simulation can be compared
quantitatively. We obtain good agreement for the stiff director regime. The
crossover to the flexible director regime is expected at wavelengths of the
order of several thousand particle diameters, which was not accessible to our
simulations.
