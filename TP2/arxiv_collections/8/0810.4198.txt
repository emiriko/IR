We consider transport of dilute two-dimensional electrons, with temperature
between Fermi and Debye temperatures. In this regime, electrons form a
nondegenerate plasma with mobility limited by potential disorder. Different
kinds of impurities contribute unique signatures to the resulting
temperature-dependent Drude conductivity, via energy-dependent scattering. This
opens up a way to characterize sample disorder composition. In particular,
neutral impurities cause a slow decrease in conductivity with temperature,
whereas charged impurities result in conductivity growing as a square root of
temperature. This observation serves as a precaution for literally interpreting
metallic or insulating conductivity dependence, as both can be found in a
classical metallic system.
