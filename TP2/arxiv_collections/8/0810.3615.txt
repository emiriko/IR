Closed form analytical expressions are obtained for the Wigner transform of
the Bloch density matrix and for the Wigner phase space density of a two
dimensional harmonically trapped charged quantum gas in a uniform magnetic
field of arbitrary strength, at zero and nonzero temperatures. An exact
analytic expression is also obtained for the autocorrelation function. The
strong magnetic field case, where only few Landau levels are occupied, is also
examined, and useful approximate expressions for the spatial and momentum
densities are given.
