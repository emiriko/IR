The recent developments on PYQUEN, HYDJET and HYDJET++ event generators are
presented. The partonic energy loss model PYQUEN is implemented as the
modification of the "standard" jet event obtained with the generator of
hadron-hadron interactions PYTHIA. HYDJET and HYDJET++ are the Monte-Carlo
event generators for the simulation of relativistic heavy ion AA collisions
considered as a superposition of the soft, hydro-type state and the hard,
multi-parton fragmentation. HYDJET++ model is the development and continuation
of HYDJET generator, and it includes more detailed treatment of the "thermal"
hadronic state generated on the chemical and thermal freeze-out hypersurfaces
(represented by the parameterization of relativistic hydrodynamics with preset
freeze-out conditions), collective flow effects and decays of hadronic
resonances. Some applications of above models to novel jet quenching
observables are discussed.
