Using psi(3770) --> DDbar events collected with the CLEO-c detector at the
Cornell e+ e- storage ring, tagged by fully reconstructing one D meson in a
hadronic decay mode, we measure absolute branching fractions and differential
decay rates for D0 --> pi- e+ nu(e), D+ --> pi0 e+ nu(e), D0 --> K- e+ nu(e),
and D+ --> anti-K0 e+ nu(e). The measured decay rates are used to study
semileptonic form factors governing these transitions and to test unquenched
Lattice QCD (LQCD) calculations. We average our results with previously
published CLEO-c measurements of the same quantities using a neutrino
reconstruction technique. Combining LQCD calculations of form factor absolute
normalizations f+(0) and measurements of f(pi)+(0)*|Vcd| and f(K)+(0)*|Vcs|, we
find |Vcd| = 0.223(8)(3)(23) and |Vcs| = 1.019(10)(7)(106), where the
uncertainties are statistical, experimental systematic, and from LQCD,
respectively.
