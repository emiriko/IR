We define mutation on coloured quivers associated to tilting objects in
higher cluster categories. We show that this operation is compatible with the
mutation operation on the tilting objects. This gives a combinatorial approach
to tilting in higher cluster categories and especially an algorithm to
determine the Gabriel quivers of tilting objects in such categories.
