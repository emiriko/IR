Borodin et al figured out a gap of the paper published at J. Combinatorial
Theory Ser. B (Vol.96 (2006) 958--963), and gave a new proof with the similar
technique. The purpose of this note is to fix the gap by slightly revising the
definition of special faces, and adding a few lines of explanation in the
proofs (new added text are all in black font).
