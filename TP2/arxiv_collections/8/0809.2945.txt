If we want to explain the recently discovered accelerated stage of the
universe, one of the option we have is to modify the Einstein tensor. The
simplest such modification, in agreement with all observations, is the positive
cosmological constant $\Lambda$. Such a modification will also have its impact
on local observables and on the propagation of weak gravitational waves. We
show here that the inclusion of a cosmological constant impedes the detection
of a gravitational wave if the latter is produced at a distance larger than
${\cal L}_{\rm crit}=(6\sqrt{2}\pi f \hat{h}/\sqrt{5})r_{\Lambda}^2$ where
$r_{\Lambda}=1/\sqrt{\Lambda}$ and $f$ and $\hat{h}$ are the frequency and the
strain of the wave, respectively. ${\cal L}_{\rm crit}$ is of astrophysical
order of magnitude. We interpret the result in the sense that the gravitational
wave interpretation is only possible if the characteristic wave properties are
smaller than the non-oscillatory solution due to $\Lambda$.
