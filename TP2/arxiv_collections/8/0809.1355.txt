We compute the one-loop QCD amplitude for the process gg-->Q\bar{Q} in
dimensional regularization through order \epsilon^2 in the dimensional
regulator and for arbitrary quark mass values. This result is an ingredient of
the NNLO cross-section for heavy quark production at hadron colliders. The
calculation is performed in conventional dimensional regularization, using well
known reduction techniques as well as a method based on recent ideas for the
functional form of one-loop integrands in four dimensions.
