We present an overview of the indirect constraints from flavor physics on
supersymmetric models. During the past few years flavor data, and in particular
b -> s gamma transitions, have been extensively used in order to constrain
supersymmetric parameter spaces. We will briefly illustrate here the
constraints obtained by a collection of low energy observables including FCNC
transitions, rare decays, leptonic and semileptonic decays of B mesons, as well
as leptonic decays of K mesons. The theoretical predictions can be obtained
using the computer program SuperIso.
