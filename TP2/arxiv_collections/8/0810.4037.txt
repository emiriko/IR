We propose a new kind of spin manipulation method using a {\it fictitious}
magnetic field generated by a quasi-electrostatic field. The method can be
applicable to every atom with electron spins and has distinct advantages of
small photon scattering rate and local addressability. By using a $\rm{CO_2}$
laser as a quasi-electrostatic field, we have experimentally demonstrated the
proposed method by observing the Rabi-oscillation of the ground state hyperfine
spin F=1 of the cold $\rm{^{87}Rb}$ atoms and the Bose-Einstein condensate.
