Population of a number of excited levels of 51V and 57Fe has been determined
from the data of the ENDSF file up to the excitation energy of about 7 and 5.2
MeV, respectively. It cannot be reproduced in the region of their maximal
energies in the framework of assumption on the independence of partial
radiative widths on the structure of decaying level and excited one, at least,
lower than 0.5Bn. Therefore, it is impossible to estimate the actual degree of
reliability of data on the level density and radiative widths of cascade
gamma-transitions in light spherical nuclei obtained from the spectrum analysis
of nuclear reactions, which do not take into account this circumstance.
