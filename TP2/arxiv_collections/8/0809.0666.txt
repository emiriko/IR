We report on optical measurements of the 1D Heisenberg antiferromagnet KCuF3.
The crystal-field excitations of the Cu2+ ions have been observed and their
temperature dependence can be understood in terms of magnetic and
exchange-induced dipole mechanisms and vibronic interactions. Above T_N we
observe a new temperature scale T_S characterized by the emergence of narrow
absorption features that correlate with changes of the orbital ordering as
observed by Paolasini et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 88, 106403 (2002)]. The
appearance of these optical transitions provides evidence for a symmetry change
above the Neel temperature that affects the orbital ordering and paves the way
for the antiferromagnetic ordering.
