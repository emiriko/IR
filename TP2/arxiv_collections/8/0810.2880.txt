Crab cavities have been proposed for a wide number of accelerators and
interest in crab cavities has recently increased after the successful operation
of a pair of crab cavities in KEK-B. In particular crab cavities are required
for both the ILC and CLIC linear colliders for bunch alignment. Consideration
of bunch structure and size constraints favour a 3.9 GHz superconducting,
multi-cell cavity as the solution for ILC, whilst bunch structure and
beam-loading considerations suggest an X-band copper travelling wave structure
for CLIC. These two cavity solutions are very different in design but share
complex design issues. Phase stabilisation, beam loading, wakefields and mode
damping are fundamental issues for these crab cavities. Requirements and
potential design solutions will be discussed for both colliders.
