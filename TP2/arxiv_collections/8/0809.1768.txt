In the D0-D4-brane system, D0-branes do not tunnel. Instead, they form bound
states with the D4-brane, whose ground states are exact. However, the D0-brane
quantum mechanics contains a BPS instanton. To what does this solution
correspond? We find that such a tunneling solution provides non-perturbative
corrections to the Berry phase connection for the first-excited states as the
D4-branes are moved adiabatically. We compute this connection for the first
four excited states, and show that it gives an emergent SO(5) connection
described previously by Tchrakian.
