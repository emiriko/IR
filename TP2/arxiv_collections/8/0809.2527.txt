We experimentally demonstrate optical spectroscopy of magnetically trapped
atoms on an atom chip. High resolution optical spectra of individual trapped
clouds are recorded within a few hundred milliseconds. Detection sensitivities
close to the single atom level are obtained by photoionization of the excited
atoms and subsequent ion detection with a channel electron multiplier.
Temperature and decay rates of the trapped atomic cloud can be monitored in
real time for several seconds with only little detection losses. The
spectrometer can be used for investigations of ultracold atomic mixtures and
for the development of interferometric quantum sensors on atom chips.
