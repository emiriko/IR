We study a composite photon-Bose condensed atoms (BEC) system in an optical
lattice confined in a cavity. We show that the system is able to produce an
effective photon-photon repulsion in the presence of an external pump. We
predict for the first time zero-temperature quantum phases of light coupled to
BEC in the photon blockade regime in the presence of an external pump.
