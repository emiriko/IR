This paper is devoted to the first analyses based on the complete data sample
collected by the KLOE detector at DAPHNE, the Frascati \phi-factory. The result
for the BR(K_S -> \gamma\gamma) and the search for the decay K_S->e+e- are
presented. Particular emphasis is put on the measurement of the ratio of Ke2
and Kmu2 BR's.
