The suppression of single jets at high transverse momenta in a quark-gluon
plasma is studied at RHIC energies, and the additional information provided by
a photon tag is included. The energy loss of hard jets traversing through the
medium is evaluated in the AMY formalism, by consistently taking into account
the contributions from radiative events and from elastic collisions at leading
order in the coupling. The strongly-interacting medium in these collisions is
modelled with (3+1)-dimensional ideal relativistic hydrodynamics. Putting these
ingredients together with a complete set of photon-production processes, we
present a calculation of the nuclear modification of single jets and
photon-tagged jets at RHIC.
