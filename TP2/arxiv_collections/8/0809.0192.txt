We studied phase coherent phenomena in mesoscopic Permalloy samples by
exploring low temperature transport. Both, differential conductance as a
function of bias voltage and magnetoconductance of individual wires display
conductance fluctuations. Analysis of these fluctuations yields a phase
coherence length of $\sim250$ nm at 25 mK as well as a $1/\sqrt{T}$ temperature
dependence. To suppress conductance fluctuations by ensemble averaging we
investigated low temperature transport in wire arrays and extended Permalloy
films. In these samples we have measured conductance corrections which stem
from electron-electron interaction (EEI) but attempts to detect signatures of
weak localization were without success.
