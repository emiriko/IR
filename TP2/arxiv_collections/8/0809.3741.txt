We propose to investigate infrared properties of gluon and ghost propagators
related to the so-called Gribov-Zwanziger confinement scenario, originally
formulated for Landau and Coulomb gauges, for other gauges as well. We present
results of our investigation of SU(2) lattice gauge theory in the maximally
Abelian gauge (MAG), focusing on the behavior of propagators in the
off-diagonal (i.e. non-Abelian) sector. We also comment on our preliminary
results for general linear covariant gauges, in particular for Feynman gauge.
