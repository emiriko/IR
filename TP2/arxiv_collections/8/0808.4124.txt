Measurements of double helicity asymmetries for inclusive hadron production
in polarized proton-proton collisions are sensitive to spin-dependent parton
distribution functions, in particular to the gluon distribution function. This
study focuses on double helicity asymmetries in eta and charged pion production
at mid-rapidity, as well as on the eta cross section and fragmentation
functions.
