We have studied magnetically frustrated Tb$_2$Sn$_2$O$_7$ by neutron
diffraction and high resolution energy-resolved neutron scattering. At 0.1 K,
we observe short range magnetic correlations with a typical scale of 4 \AA,
close to the near neighbor distance between Tb$^{3+}$ ions. %(3.686 \AA), This
short range order coexists with ferromagnetic correlations and long range spin
ice order at the scales of 18 and 190 \AA, respectively. Spin dynamics was
investigated at a time scale down to 10$^{-9}$s, by energy-resolved experiments
on a backscattering spectrometer. We observe a freezing of the spin dynamics
for all length-scales, with a strong slowing down of the spin fluctuations when
long range order settles in. We discuss the spin fluctuations remaining in the
ground state in comparison with previous data obtained by muon spectroscopy.
