Driven by the reduction of dangling bonds and the minimization of surface
stress, reconstruction of silicon surfaces leads to a striking diversity of
outcomes. Despite this variety even very elaborate structures are generally
comprised of a small number of structural building blocks. We here identify
important elementary building blocks and discuss their integration into the
structural models as well as their impact on the electronic structure of the
surface.
