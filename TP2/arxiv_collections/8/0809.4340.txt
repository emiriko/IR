Each elliptic curve can be embedded uniquely in the projective plane, up to
projective equivalence. The hessian curve of the embedding is generically a new
elliptic curve, whose isomorphism type depends only on that of the initial
elliptic curve. One gets like this a rational map from the moduli space of
elliptic curves to itself. We call it the hessian dynamical system. We compute
it in terms of the $j$-invariant of elliptic curves. We deduce that, seen as a
map from a projective line to itself, it has 3 critical values, which
correspond to the point at infinity of the moduli space and to the two elliptic
curves with special symmetries. Moreover, it sends the set of critical values
into itself, which shows that all its iterates have the same set of critical
values. One gets like this a sequence of dessins d'enfants. We describe an
algorithm allowing to construct this sequence.
