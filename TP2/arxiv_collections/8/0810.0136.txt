We present some early results from a high statistics study of the scalar and
pseudoscalar singlet sectors of lattice QCD using 2+1 flavours of Asqtad
improved staggered fermions. The use of the Asqtad action has allowed us to
generate an unprecedented number of configurations at 2 lattice spacings which
on completion we hope will give us a significantly improved view of both the
scalar and pseudoscalar singlet sectors.
