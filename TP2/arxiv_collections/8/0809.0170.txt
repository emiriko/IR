The effect of the Coulomb interaction on the phase diagram of finite nuclei
is studied within the Canonical Thermodynamic Model. If Coulomb effects are
artificially switched off, this model shows a phenomenology consistent with the
liquid-gas phase transition. The inclusion of Coulomb does not significantly
affect the phase diagram but it drastically modifies the nature and order
parameter of the transition. A clear understanding of the phenomenon can be
achieved looking at the distribution of the largest fragment produced in each
fragmentation event. Possible connections with experimental observations are
outlined.
