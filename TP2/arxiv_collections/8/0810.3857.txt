The first measurements of the longitudinal proton structure function FL in
deep inelastic positron-proton scattering at low Bjorken x are described.
Theoretical predictions in higher order QCD and using dipol model calculations
are consistent with the measurements. The data were taken by the HERA
experiments H1 and ZEUS in a series of runs with different proton beam energies
in 2007.
