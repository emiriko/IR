We review the properties of nuclear halos and nuclear skins in drip line
nuclei in the framework of the spherical Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov theory with
continuum effects and projection on good particle number with the Gogny force.
We first establish the position of the un-projected HFB drip lines for the two
most employed parametrizations of the Gogny force and show that the use of
finite-range interactions leads almost always to small-sized halos, even in the
least bound nuclei, which is in agreement with most mean-field predictions. We
also discuss the size of the neutron skin at the drip line and its relation to
neutron asymmetry. The impact of particle-number projection and its conceptual
consequences near the drip line are analyzed in detail. In particular, we
discuss the role of the chemical potential in a projected theory and the
criteria required to define the drip line. We show that including particle
number projection can shift the latter, in particular near closed shells. We
notice that, as a result, the size of the halo can be increased due to larger
pairing correlations. However, combining the most realistic pairing
interaction, a proper treatment of the continuum and particle number projection
does not permit to reproduce the very large halos observed in very light
nuclei.
