The Dirac equation in (1+1) dimensions with a non-local PT-symmetric
potential of separable type is studied by means of the Green function method:
properties of bound and scattering states are derived in full detail and
numerical results are shown for a potential kernel of Yamaguchi type, inspired
by the treatment of low-energy nucleon-nucleon interaction.
