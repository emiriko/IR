We reanalyzed our atom interferometer measurement of the electric
polarizability of lithium now accounting for the Sagnac effect due to Earth
rotation. The resulting correction to the polarizability is very small but the
visibility as a function of the applied phase shift is now better explained.
The fact that the Sagnac and polarizability phase shifts are both proportional
to $v^{-1}$, where $v$ is the atom velocity, suggests that a phase shift of the
Sagnac type could be used as a counterphase to compensate the electric
polarizability phase shift. This exact compensation opens the way to higher
accuracy measurements of atomic polarizabilities and we discuss how this can be
practically done and the final limitations of the proposed technique.
