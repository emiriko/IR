We consider a generalized class of Keller-Segel models describing the
chemotaxis of biological populations (bacteria, amoebae, endothelial cells,
social insects,...). We show the analogy with nonlinear mean field
Fokker-Planck equations and generalized thermodynamics. As an illustration, we
introduce a new model of chemotaxis incorporating both effects of anomalous
diffusion and exclusion principle (volume filling). We also discuss the analogy
between biological populations described by the Keller-Segel model and
self-gravitating Brownian particles described by the Smoluchowski-Poisson
system.
