Let X be a smooth complex affine curve, and let R be the space of right ideal
classes in the ring D of differential operators on X. We introduce and study a
fibration \gamma : R \to Pic(X). We relate this fibration to the corresponding
one in the classical limit, and derive an integer invariant $ n $ which indexes
the decomposition of the fibres of \gamma into Calogero-Moser spaces (see
[BC]). We also study the action of the group Pic(D) on our fibration; and we
explain how to define \gamma in the framework of the Grassmannian description
of R due to Cannings and Holland.
