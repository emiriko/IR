We propose a generalized Bell inequality for two three-dimensional systems
with three settings in each local measurement. It is shown that this inequality
is maximally violated if local measurements are configured to be mutually
unbiased and a composite state is maximally entangled. This feature is similar
to Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt inequality for two qubits but is in contrast with
the two types of inequalities, Collins-Gisin-Linden-Massar-Popescu and
Son-Lee-Kim, for high-dimensional systems. The generalization to aribitrary
prime-dimensional systems is discussed.
