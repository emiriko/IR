The Gamow states describe the quasinormal modes of quantum systems. It is
shown that the resonance amplitude associated with the Gamow states is given by
the complex delta function. It is also shown that under the near-resonance
approximation of neglecting the lower bound of the energy, such resonance
amplitude becomes the Breit-Wigner amplitude. This result establishes the
precise connection between the Gamow states, Nakanishi's complex delta function
and the Breit-Wigner amplitude. In addition, this result provides another
theoretical basis for the phenomenological fact that the almost-Lorentzian
peaks in cross sections are produced by intermediate, unstable particles.
