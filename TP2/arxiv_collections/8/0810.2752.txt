Based on Lienard-Weichert retarded potentials and the potential due to the
image of charges on the cathode, a rigorous relativistic description of the
beam transport inside the RF-photoinjector is presented. The velocity dependent
effects are taken into account. Simulations are presented for parameters of the
"ELSA" photo-cathode
