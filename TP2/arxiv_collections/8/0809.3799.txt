We investigate the behavior of the dc voltage drop in a periodically driven
double barrier structure (DBS) sensed by voltages probes that are weakly
coupled to the system. We find that the four terminal resistance $R_{4t}$
measured with the probes located outside the DBS results identical to the
resistance measured in the same structure under a stationary bias voltage
difference between left and right reservoirs. This result, valid beyond the
adiabatic pumping regime, can be taken as an indication of the universal
character of $R_{4t}$ as a measure of the resistive properties of a sample,
irrespectively of the mechanism used to induce the transport.
