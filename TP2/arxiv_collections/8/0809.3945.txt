A set of key properties for an ideal dissipation scheme in gyrokinetic
simulations is proposed, and implementation of a model collision operator
satisfying these properties is described. This operator is based on the exact
linearized test-particle collision operator, with approximations to the
field-particle terms that preserve conservation laws and an H-Theorem. It
includes energy diffusion, pitch-angle scattering, and finite Larmor radius
effects corresponding to classical (real-space) diffusion. The numerical
implementation in the continuum gyrokinetic code GS2 is fully implicit and
guarantees exact satisfaction of conservation properties. Numerical results are
presented showing that the correct physics is captured over the entire range of
collisionalities, from the collisionless to the strongly collisional regimes,
without recourse to artificial dissipation.
