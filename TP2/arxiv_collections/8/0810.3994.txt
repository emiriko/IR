Sizing methods can be used to get a first estimate of the required Hall
thruster dimensions and operating conditions for a given input power and a
corresponding thrust level. After a review of the existing methods, a new
approach, which considers the three characteristic thruster dimensions, i.e.
the channel length, the channel width and the channel mean diameter as well as
the magnetic field, is introduced. This approach is based on analytical laws
deduced from the physical principles that govern the properties of a Hall
effect thruster, relying on a list of simplifying assumptions. In addition,
constraints on the channel wall temperature as well as on the propellant atom
density inside the channel are taken into account. The validity of the scaling
laws is discussed in light of a vast database that comprises 23 single-stage
Hall effect thrusters covering a power range from 10 W to 50 kW. Finally, the
sizing method is employed to obtain a preliminary geometry and the magnetic
field strength for a 20 kW and a 25 kW Hall effect thruster able to deliver a
thrust of 1 N, respectively 1.5 N.
