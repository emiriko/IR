We consider a stochastic environment with two time scales and outline a
general theory that compares two methods to reduce the dimension of the
original system. The first method involves the computation of the underlying
deterministic center manifold followed by a naive replacement of the stochastic
term. The second method allows one to more accurately describe the stochastic
effects and involves the derivation of a normal form coordinate transform that
is used to find the stochastic center manifold. The results of both methods are
used along with the path integral formalism of large fluctuation theory to
predict the escape rate from one basin of attraction to another. The general
theory is applied to the example of a surface flow described by a generic,
singularly perturbed, damped, nonlinear oscillator with additive, Gaussian
noise. We show how both nonlinear reduction methods compare in escape rate
scaling. Additionally, the center manifolds are shown to predict high
pre-history probability regions of escape. The theoretical results are
confirmed using numerical computation of the mean escape time and escape
prehistory, and we briefly discuss the extension of the theory to stochastic
control.
