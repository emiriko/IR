Mass thresholds, lifetimes, entropy and heat capacity for micro black holes
close to their late Schwarzschild phase are computed using two different
generalized uncertainty principles, in the framework of models with extra
spatial dimensions. Emissions of both photons and gravitons (in the bulk) are
taken into account. Results are discussed and compared.
