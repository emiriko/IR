We present a first-principles theory for the active nonlinear microrheology
of colloidal model systems: for constant external force on a spherical probe
particle embedded in a dense host dispersion, neglecting hydrodynamic
interactions, we derive an exact expression for the friction. Within
mode-coupling theory (MCT), we discuss the threshold external force needed to
delocalize the probe from a host glass, and its relation to strong nonlinear
velocity-force curves in a host fluid. Experimental microrheology data and
simulations, which we performed, are explained with a simplified model.
