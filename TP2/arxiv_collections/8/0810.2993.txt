The charmed-strange meson masses are calculated on a quenched lattice QCD.
The charm and strange quark propagators are calculated on the same lattice with
the overlap fermion. $16^3\times 72$ lattice with Wilson gauge action at
$\beta=0.6345$ are used. The charm and strange quark masses are determined by
fitting the $J/\psi$ and $\phi$ masses respectively. The charmed strange meson
spectrum for the scalar, axial, pseudoscalar and vector channels are
calculated. They agree with experiments. In particular, we find the scalar
meson mass to be 2248(78)MeV which is in agreement with that of D_{s0}^*(2317).
