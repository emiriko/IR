Most works related to unithood were conducted as part of a larger effort for
the determination of termhood. Consequently, the number of independent research
that study the notion of unithood and produce dedicated techniques for
measuring unithood is extremely small. We propose a new approach, independent
of any influences of termhood, that provides dedicated measures to gather
linguistic evidence from parsed text and statistical evidence from Google
search engine for the measurement of unithood. Our evaluations revealed a
precision and recall of 98.68% and 91.82% respectively with an accuracy at
95.42% in measuring the unithood of 1005 test cases.
