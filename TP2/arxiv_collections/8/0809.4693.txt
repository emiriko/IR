We prove that with probability tending to 1, a 1-relator group with at least
3 generators and relator of length n is residually finite, virtually residually
(finite p)-group for all sufficiently large p, and coherent. The proof uses
both combinatorial group theory and non-trivial results about Brownian motions,
bridges and excursions in R^k.
