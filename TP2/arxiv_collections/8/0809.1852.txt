We have developed a picovoltmeter using a Nb dc Superconducting QUantum
Interference Device (SQUID) for measuring the flux-flow voltage from a small
number of vortices moving through a submicron weak-pinning superconducting
channel. We have applied this picovoltmeter to measure the vortex response in a
single channel arranged in a circle on a Corbino disk geometry. The circular
channel allows the vortices to follow closed orbits without encountering any
sample edges, thus eliminating the influence of entry barriers.
