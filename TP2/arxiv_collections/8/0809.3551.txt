A concise method is presented for the non-perturbative computation of the
counterterms renormalising 2PI-actions. The procedure is presented for a real
scalar field up to lambda^2 order in the skeleton truncation of Gamma_2PI with
respect to the self-coupling, and in a constant symmetry breaking background.
The method is easily generalizable to field theories with arbitrary global
symmetry.
