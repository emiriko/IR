We show that the characteristic series for the greedy normal form of a
Coxeter group is always a rational series, and prove a reciprocity formula for
this series when the group is right-angled and the nerve is Eulerian. As
corollaries we obtain many of the known rationality and reciprocity results for
the growth series of Coxeter groups as well as some new ones.
