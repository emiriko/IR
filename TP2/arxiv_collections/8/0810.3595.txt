We outline the key elements of a recent calculation aimed at determining the
equation of state of deconfined (but unpaired) quark matter at zero temperature
and high density, using finite quark masses. The computation is performed in
perturbation theory up to three loops, and necessitates the development and
application of some novel computational tools. In this talk, we introduce the
basic features of these new techniques and review the main sources of
motivation for considering finite quark mass effects in perturbation theory.
