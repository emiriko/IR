We investigate structures of 2D quantum electron-hole (e-h) plasmas by the
direct path integral Monte Carlo method (PIMC) in a wide range of temperature,
density and hole-to-electron mass ratio. Our simulation includes a region of
appearance and decay of the bound states (excitons and biexcitons), the Mott
transition from the neutral e-h plasma to metallic-like clusters, formation
from clusters the hexatic-like liquid and formation of the crystal-like
lattice.
