This paper presents concentration inequalities and laws of large numbers
under weak assumptions of irrelevance, expressed through lower and upper
expectations. The results are variants and extensions of De Cooman and
Miranda's recent inequalities and laws of large numbers. The proofs indicate
connections between concepts of irrelevance for lower/upper expectations and
the standard theory of martingales.
