We propose a design for optical-frequency double-negative metamaterials
(DMNs) in which the unit cell is formed by a single-layer plasmonic inclusion.
By introducing some properly arranged stepwise modulations onto the inclusions,
the effective permittivity and permeability of the material may become
simultaneously negative due to the excitation of higher-order multipole
plamonic (electrostatic) resonances. The approach opens a possibility to
construct low-loss optical DNMs with great engineering simplicity.
