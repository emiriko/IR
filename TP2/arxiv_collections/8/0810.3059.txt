We investigate the magnetic field distribution inside a Type II
superconductor which has point group symmetry $O$ such as Li$_2$Pt$_3$B. The
absence of inversion symmetry as a departure from perfect cubic group $O_h$
causes a magnetization collinear with the phase gradient associated with the
order parameter, and a component of current collinear with the local magnetic
field. In the vortex state, we predict, by solving the Maxwell equation, a
local magnetic field transverse to the vortex lines. The probability
distribution of this transverse field is also obtained for the prospective
muon-spin-rotation measurements.
