We report a simulation study on interacting ensembles of Co nanomagnets that
can perform basic logic operations and propagate logic signals, where the state
variable is the magnetization direction. Dipole field coupling between
individual nanomagnets drives the logic functionality of the ensemble and
coordinated arrangements of the nanomagnets allow for the logic signal to
propagate in a predictable way. Problems with the integrity of the logic signal
arising from instabilities in the constituent magnetizations are solved by
introducing a biaxial anisotropy term to the Gibbs magnetic free energy of each
nanomagnet. The enhanced stability allows for more complex components of a
logic architecture capable of random combinatorial logic, including horizontal
wires, vertical wires, junctions, fanout nodes, and a novel universal logic
gate. Our simulations define the focus of scaling trends in nanomagnet-based
logic and provide estimates of the energy dissipation and time per nanomagnet
reversal.
