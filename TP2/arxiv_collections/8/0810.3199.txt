We describe a structured system for distributed mechanism design. It consists
of a sequence of layers. The lower layers deal with the operations relevant for
distributed computing only, while the upper layers are concerned only with
communication among players, including broadcasting and multicasting, and
distributed decision making. This yields a highly flexible distributed system
whose specific applications are realized as instances of its top layer.
  This design supports fault-tolerance, prevents manipulations and makes it
possible to implement distributed policing. The system is implemented in Java.
We illustrate it by discussing a number of implemented examples.
