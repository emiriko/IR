In this paper we derive the Schroedinger equation by assuming it describes
the time evolution of a deterministic and reversible process that leaves at
each moment in time a different observable well defined; that is, it allows an
accurate prediction for it. We also derive an expression for the well defined
observable and apply this expression to the cases of spin precession and a free
particle.
