We prove a strong non-structure theorem for a class of metric structures with
an unstable pair of formulae. As a consequence, we show that weak categoricity
(that is, categoricity up to isomorphisms and not isometries) implies several
versions of stability. This is the first step in the direction of the
investigation of weak categoricity and weak stability of metric classes.
