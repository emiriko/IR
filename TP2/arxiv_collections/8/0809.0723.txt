The focused web-harvesting is deployed to realize an automated and
comprehensive index databases as an alternative way for virtual topical data
integration. The web-harvesting has been implemented and extended by not only
specifying the targeted URLs, but also predefining human-edited harvesting
parameters to improve the speed and accuracy. The harvesting parameter set
comprises three main components. First, the depth-scale of being harvested
final pages containing desired information counted from the first page at the
targeted URLs. Secondly, the focus-point number to determine the exact box
containing relevant information. Lastly, the combination of keywords to
recognize encountered hyperlinks of relevant images or full-texts embedded in
those final pages. All parameters are accessible and fully customizable for
each target by the administrators of participating institutions over an
integrated web interface. A real implementation to the Indonesian Scientific
Index which covers all scientific information across Indonesia is also briefly
introduced.
