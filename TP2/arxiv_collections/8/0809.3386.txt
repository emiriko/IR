We have investigated proximity-induced supercurrents in single-walled carbon
nanotubes in the Kondo regime and compared them with supercurrents obtained on
the same tube with Fabry-P\'{e}rot resonances. Our data display a wide
distribution of Kondo temperatures \emph{$T_K$} = 1 - 14 K, and the measured
critical current $I_{CM}$ vs. \emph{$T_K$} displays two distinct branches;
these branches, distinguished by zero-bias splitting of the normal-state Kondo
conductance peak, differ by an order of magnitude at large values of $T_K$.
Evidence for renormalization of Andreev levels in Kondo regime is also found.
