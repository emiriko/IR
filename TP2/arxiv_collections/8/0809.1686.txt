The purpose of this paper is to present a new approach to ecological model
calibration -- an agent-based software. This agent works on three stages: 1- It
builds a matrix that synthesizes the inter-variable relationships; 2- It
analyses the steady-state sensitivity of different variables to different
parameters; 3- It runs the model iteratively and measures model lack of fit,
adequacy and reliability. Stage 3 continues until some convergence criteria are
attained. At each iteration, the agent knows from stages 1 and 2, which
parameters are most likely to produce the desired shift on predicted results.
