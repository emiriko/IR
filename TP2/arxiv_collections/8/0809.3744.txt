In the first part of the thesis, and after an introduction to certain models
of modified gravity, we study consistent Lagrangians for Lorentz invariant
(massive and massless) spin-2 and spin-3/2 particles in flat space. The second
part of the dissertation is devoted to non-linear extensions for the spin-2
case, focusing on unimodular gravity and bigravity. Both theories lead to
modifications of General Relativity at large distances and we will study exact
solutions, causal structure of those solutions, and perturbation theory
(specially for the Lorentz breaking case). Some comments on quantization of
these theories can be found in an appendix.
