We derive, and experimentally demonstrate, an interferometric scheme for
unambiguous phase estimation with precision scaling at the Heisenberg limit
that does not require adaptive measurements. That is, with no prior knowledge
of the phase, we can obtain an estimate of the phase with a standard deviation
that is only a small constant factor larger than the minimum physically allowed
value. Our scheme resolves the phase ambiguity that exists when multiple passes
through a phase shift, or NOON states, are used to obtain improved phase
resolution. Like a recently introduced adaptive technique [Higgins et al 2007
Nature 450 393], our experiment uses multiple applications of the phase shift
on single photons. By not requiring adaptive measurements, but rather using a
predetermined measurement sequence, the present scheme is both conceptually
simpler and significantly easier to implement. Additionally, we demonstrate a
simplified adaptive scheme that also surpasses the standard quantum limit for
single passes.
