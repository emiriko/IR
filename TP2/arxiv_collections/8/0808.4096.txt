We present selected recent results of multi-hadron correlation measurements
in azimuth and pseudorapidity at intermediate and high \pt{} in Au+Au
collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$ GeV, from the STAR experiment at RHIC. At
intermediate \pt, measurements are presented that attempt to determine the
origin of the associated near-side (small \dphi) yield at large pseudo-rapidity
difference \deta{} that is found to be present in heavy ion collisions. In
addition, results are reported on new multi-hadron correlation measures at
high-\pt{} that use di-hadron triggers and multi-hadron cluster triggers with
the goal to constrain the underlying jet kinematics better than in the existing
measurements of inclusive spectra and di-hadron correlations.
