Subject of this letter is the dynamics of a chain obtained performing the
continuous limit of a system of links and beads. In particular, the probability
distribution of the relative position between two points of the chain averaged
over a given interval of time is computed. The physical meaning of the obtained
result is investigated in the limiting case of a stiff chain.
