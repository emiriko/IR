In this note we give an example of a group which is locally embeddable into
finite groups (in particular it is initially subamenable, sofic and hence
hyperlinear) but does not have Kirchberg's factorization property. This group
provides also an example of a sofic Kazhdan group which is not residually
finite, answering a question of Elek and Szabo. We also give an example of a
group which is not initially subamenable but hyperlinear. Finally, we point out
a mistake in an assertion of Kirchberg and provide an example of a group which
does not have the factorization property and is still a subgroup of a connected
finite-dimensional Lie group.
