We propose a universal approach for analysis and fast simulations of stiff
stochastic biochemical kinetics networks, which rests on elimination of fast
chemical species without a loss of information about mesoscopic, non-Poissonian
fluctuations of the slow ones. Our approach, which is similar to the
Born-Oppenheimer approximation in quantum mechanics, follows from the
stochastic path integral representation of the full counting statistics of
reaction events (also known as the cumulant generating function). In
applications with a small number of chemical reactions, this approach produces
analytical expressions for moments of chemical fluxes between slow variables.
This allows for a low-dimensional, interpretable representation of the
biochemical system, that can be used for coarse-grained numerical simulation
schemes with a small computational complexity and yet high accuracy. As an
example, we consider a chain of biochemical reactions, derive its
coarse-grained description, and show that the Gillespie simulations of the
original stiff system, the coarse-grained simulations, and the full analytical
treatment are in an agreement, but the coarse-grained simulations are three
orders of magnitude faster than the Gillespie analogue.
