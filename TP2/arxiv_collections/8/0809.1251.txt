We address weak approximation for certain del Pezzo surfaces defined over the
function field of a curve. We study the rational connectivity of the smooth
locus of degree two del Pezzo surfaces with two A1 singularities in order to
prove weak approximation for degree two del Pezzo surfaces with square-free
discriminant.
