A class of inhomogeneous nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations (NLS), claiming to
be novel integrable systems with rich properties continues appearing in PhysRev
and PRL. All such equations are shown to be not new but equivalent to the
standard NLS, which trivially explains their integrability features.
