We consider the perturbation of parabolic operators of the form
  $\partial_t+P(x,D)$ by large-amplitude highly oscillatory spatially dependent
potentials modeled as Gaussian random fields. The amplitude of the potential is
chosen so that the solution to the random equation is affected by the
randomness at the leading order. We show that, when the dimension is smaller
than the order of the elliptic pseudo-differential operator $P(x,D)$, the
perturbed parabolic equation admits a solution given by a Duhamel expansion.
Moreover, as the correlation length of the potential vanishes, we show that the
latter solution converges in distribution to the solution of a stochastic
parabolic equation with a multiplicative term that should be interpreted in the
Stratonovich sense. The theory of mild solutions for such stochastic partial
differential equations is developed. The behavior described above should be
contrasted to the case of dimensions that are larger than or equal to the order
of the elliptic pseudo-differential operator $P(x,D)$. In the latter case, the
solution to the random equation converges strongly to the solution of a
homogenized (deterministic) parabolic equation as is shown in the companion
paper [2]. The stochastic model is therefore valid only for sufficiently small
space dimensions in this class of parabolic problems.
