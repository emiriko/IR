We study the pair correlations of a spin-imbalanced two-leg ladder with
attractive interactions, using the density matrix renormalization group method
(DMRG). We identify regions in the phase diagram spanned by the chemical
potential and the magnetic field that can harbor
Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO)-like physics. Results for the pair
structure factor, exhibiting multiple pairing wave-vectors, substantiate the
presence of FFLO-like correlations. We further discuss phase separation
scenarios induced by a harmonic trap, which differ from the case of isolated
chains.
