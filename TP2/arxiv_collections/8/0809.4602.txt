We study the fluctuational dynamics of a tagged base-pair in double stranded
DNA. We calculate the drift force which acts on the tagged base-pair using a
potential model that describes interactions at base pairs level and use it to
construct a Fokker-Planck equation.The calculated displacement autocorrelation
function is found to be in very good agreement with the experimental result of
Altan-Bonnet {\it et. al.} Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 90}, 138101 (2003) over the
entire time range of measurement. We calculate the most probable displacements
which predominately contribute to the autocorrelation function and the
half-time history of these displacements.
