We have derived the relationship between the radial proper distance, h, and
the polar angle, phi, for a light ray that is emitted and travels in the
neighborhood of the Earth's surface. General relativity predicts that, even
locally, the equation which relates these two physical magnitudes differs from
the one stated by the principle of equivalence. More precisely, we have proved
that, in the weak field limit, the local physical trajectory, h=h(phi), is the
one that would correspond to a massive Newtonian particle in a field two times
greater. Therefore, and contrary to the generally accepted fact, the principle
of equivalence gives only 1/2 part of the general relativity local deflection
of light.
