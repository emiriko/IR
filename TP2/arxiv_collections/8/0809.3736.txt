The rovibrational electric dipole transitions in the ground electronic state
of the HD molecule are studied. A simple, yet rigorous formula is derived for
the transition rates in terms of the electric dipole moment function $D(R)$,
which is calculated in a wide range of $R$. Our numerical results for
transition rates are in moderate agreement with experiments and previous
calculations, but are at least an order of magnitude more accurate.
