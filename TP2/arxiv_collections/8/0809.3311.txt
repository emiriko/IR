We investigate a scalar potential inspired by the unparticle sector for the
electroweak symmetry breaking. The scalar potential contains the interaction
between the standard model fields and unparticle sector. It is described by the
non-integral power of fields that originates from the nontrivial scaling
dimension of the unparticle operator. It is found that the electroweak symmetry
is broken at tree level when the interaction is turned on. The scale invariance
of unparticle sector is also broken simultaneously, resulting in a physical
Higgs and a new lighter scalar particle.
