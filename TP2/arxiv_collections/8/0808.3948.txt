High-temperature superconductors at zero doping can be considered strongly
correlated two-dimensional Mott insulators. The understanding of the connection
between the superconductor and the Mott insulator hits at the heart of the
high-temperature superconducting mechanism. In this paper we investigate the
zero-temperature doping-driven evolution of a superconductor towards the Mott
insulator in a two dimensional electron model, relevant for high temperature
superconductivity. To this purpose we use a cluster extension of dynamical mean
field theory. Our results show that a standard (BCS) d-wave superconductor,
realized at high doping, is driven into the Mott insulator via an intermediate
state displaying non-standard physical properties. By restoring the
translational invariance of the lattice, we give an interpretation of these
findings in momentum space. In particular, we show that at a finite doping a
strong momentum-space differentiation takes place: non-Fermi liquid and
insulating-like (pseudogap) character rises in some regions (anti-nodes), while
Fermi liquid quasiparticles survive in other regions (nodes) of momentum space.
We describe the consequence of these happenings on the spectral properties,
stressing in particular the behavior of the superconducting gap, which reveals
two distinct nodal and antinodal energy scales as a function of doping. We
propose a description of the evolution of the electronic structure while
approaching the Mott transition and compare our results with tunneling
experiments, photoemission and magnetotransport on cuprate materials.
