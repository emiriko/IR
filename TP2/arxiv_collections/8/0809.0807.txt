We study the dynamics of a single electron spin in a double quantum dot (DQD)
and its readout via a quantum point contact (QPC). We model the system
microscopically and derive rate equations for the reduced electron density
matrix of the DQD. Two cases with one and two electrons in the DQD are studied.
In the one-electron case, with different Zeeman splittings in the two dots, the
electron spin states are distinctly characterized by a constant and an
oscillatory current through the QPC. In the two-electron case, the readout of
the spin state of the electron in one of the dots called the qubit dot is
essentially similar after considering hyperfine interactions between the
electrons and the nuclear spins of the host materials and a uniform magnetic
field applied to the DQD. Moreover, to ensure that an electron is properly
injected into the qubit dot, we propose to determine the success of the
electron injection from the variations of the QPC current after applying an
oscillating magnetic field to the qubit dot.
