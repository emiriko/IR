We analyze the potential of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) to observe
signatures of phenomenologically viable Walking Technicolor models. We study
and compare the Drell-Yan (DY) and Vector Boson Fusion (VBF) mechanisms for the
production of composite heavy vectors. We find that the heavy vectors are most
easily produced and detected via the DY processes. The composite Higgs
phenomenology is also studied. If Technicolor walks at the LHC its footprints
will be visible and our analysis will help uncovering them.
