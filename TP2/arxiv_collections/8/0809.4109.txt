Performing dependability evaluation along with other analyses at
architectural level allows both making architectural tradeoffs and predicting
the effects of architectural decisions on the dependability of an application.
This paper gives guidelines for building architectural dependability models for
software systems using the AADL (Architecture Analysis and Design Language). It
presents reusable modeling patterns for fault-tolerant applications and shows
how the presented patterns can be used in the context of a subsystem of a
real-life application.
