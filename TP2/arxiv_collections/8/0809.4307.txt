We investigate the non-Abelian Josephson effect in spinor Bose-Einstein
condensates with double optical traps. We propose, for the first time, a real
physical system which contains non-Abelian Josephson effects. The collective
modes of this weak coupling system have very different density and spin
tunneling characters comparing to the Abelian case. We calculate the
frequencies of the pseudo Goldstone modes in different phases between two traps
respectively, which are a crucial feature of the non-Abelian Josephson effects.
We also give an experimental protocol to observe this novel effect in future
experiments.
