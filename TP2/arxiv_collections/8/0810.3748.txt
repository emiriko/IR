Recent results on searches for signals of physics beyond Standard Model at
the ep collider HERA are reviewed. Limits obtained for contact interaction
models, large extra dimensions and finite quark radius are presented. Searches
for excited-fermion resonances yield unique limits on excited electrons and
neutrinos. Finally, measurement of W production cross section in ep collision
is presented.
