In university programs and curricula, in general we react to the need to meet
market needs. We respond to market stimulus, or at least try to do so. Consider
now an inverted view. Consider our data and perspectives in university programs
as reflecting and indeed presaging economic trends. In this article I pursue
this line of thinking. I show how various past events fit very well into this
new view. I provide explanation for why some technology trends happened as they
did, and why some current developments are important now.
