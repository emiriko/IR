Outline: 1. Introduction, 2. Confinement, chiral dynamics and light scalar
mesons, 3. Chiral shielding of \sigma(600), chiral constraints, \sigma(600),
f_0(980) and their mixing in \pi\pi\to\pi\pi, \pi\pi\to K\bar K, and
\phi\to\gamma\pi0\pi0, 4. The \phi meson radiative decays on light scalar
resonances. 5. Why a0(980) and f0(980) are not the K\bar K molecules. 6. Light
scalars in \gamma\gamma collisions.
  Evidence for four-quark components of light scalars is given. The priority of
Quantum Field Theory in revealing the light scalar mystery is emphasized.
