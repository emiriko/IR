Recent results obtained by the D0 Collaboration on searches for squarks and
gluinos in proton-antiproton collisions at sqrt(s) =1.96 TeV at the Fermilab
Tevatron collider are discussed. For the inclusive searches, events with
multiple jets of hadrons and large missing transverse energy in the final state
are studied within the framework of minimal supergravity and assuming R-parity
conservation. Searches for the scalar top quark are studied in two final state
topologies: with events of two charm jets and large missing transverse energy
or leptons, jets and missing transverse energy. The data, corresponding to
integrated luminosities of up to 2.1/fb, show no excess of a signal above the
expected background in any of the decay channels examined. Instead, upper
limits at 95% Confidence Level on the squarks and gluino masses are derived.
