This is a review of current theory of black-hole dynamics, concentrating on
the framework in terms of trapping horizons. Summaries are given of the
history, the classical theory of black holes, the defining ideas of dynamical
black holes, the basic laws, conservation laws for energy and angular momentum,
other physical quantities and the limit of local equilibrium. Some new material
concerns how processes such as black-hole evaporation and coalescence might be
described by a single trapping horizon which manifests temporally as separate
horizons.
