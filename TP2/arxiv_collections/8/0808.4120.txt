We present a theoretical study of magnetocapacitance in a graphene monolayer
at finite temperature taking into account the effects of disorder. The density
of states (DOS) and magnetocapacitance found for graphene are compared to those
found in standard two dimensional electron gas (2DEG) systems. The magnetic
oscillations in DOS and magnetocapacitance are found to be enhanced and much
more robust with respect to temperature damping in monolayer graphene in
comparison with a 2DEG. Furthermore, we find that there is a $\pi$ phase shift
between magnetic oscillations in the two systems which can be attributed to
Dirac electrons in graphene acquiring a Berry's phase as they traverse a closed
path in a magnetic field.
