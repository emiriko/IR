Huybrechts and Thomas recently constructed relative obstruction theory of
objects of the derived category of coherent sheaves over smooth projective
family. In this paper, we use this construction to obtain the absolute
deformation-obstruction theory of the pair (X, E), with X smooth projective
scheme and E perfect complex, and show that the obstruction theories for E,
(X,E), and X fit into exact triangle as derived objects on the moduli space.
