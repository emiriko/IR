It is well known that, when normalized by n, the expected length of a longest
common subsequence of d sequences of length n over an alphabet of size sigma
converges to a constant gamma_{sigma,d}. We disprove a speculation by Steele
regarding a possible relation between gamma_{2,d} and gamma_{2,2}. In order to
do that we also obtain new lower bounds for gamma_{sigma,d}, when both sigma
and d are small integers.
