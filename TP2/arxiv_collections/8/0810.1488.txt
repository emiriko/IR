The aim of this paper is to prove a general version of Pl\"unnecke's
inequality. Namely, assume that for finite sets $A$, $B_1, ... B_k$ we have
information on the size of the sumsets $A+B_{i_1}+... +B_{i_l}$ for all choices
of indices $i_1, ... i_l.$ Then we prove the existence of a non-empty subset
$X$ of $A$ such that we have `good control' over the size of the sumset
$X+B_1+... +B_k$. As an application of this result we generalize an inequality
of \cite{gymr} concerning the submultiplicativity of cardinalities of sumsets.
