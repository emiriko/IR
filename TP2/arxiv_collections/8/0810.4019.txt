New results on charm and beauty electroproduction from the H1 and ZEUS
Collaborations at the ep collider HERA are presented. Differential cross
sections are compared to a next-to-leading order QCD calculation. The heavy
quark contributions, F_2^{cc} and F_2^{bb}, to the proton structure function
F_2 are compared using different experimental techniques. Also, results are
shown on the charm fragmentation function, thereby testing the universality of
fragmentation.
