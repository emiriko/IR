We propose a model of a nonlinear double-well potential (NDWP), alias a
double-well pseudopotential, with the objective to study an alternative
implementation of the spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) in Bose-Einstein
condensates (BECs) and optical media, under the action of a potential with two
symmetric minima. In the limit case when the NDWP structure is induced by the
local nonlinearity coefficient represented by a set of two delta-functions, a
fully analytical solution is obtained for symmetric, antisymmetric and
asymmetric states. In this solvable model, the SSB bifurcation has a fully
subcritical character. Numerical analysis, based on both direct simulations and
computation of stability eigenvalues, demonstrates that, while the symmetric
states are stable up to the SSB bifurcation point, both symmetric and emerging
asymmetric states, as well as all antisymmetric ones, are unstable in the model
with the delta-functions. In the general model with a finite width of the
nonlinear-potential wells, the asymmetric states quickly become stable,
simultaneously with the switch of the SSB bifurcation from the subcritical to
supercritical type. Antisymmetric solutions may also get stabilized in the NDWP
structure of the general type, which gives rise to a bistability between them
and asymmetric states. The symmetric states require a finite norm for their
existence, an explanation to which is given. A full diagram for the existence
and stability of the trapped states in the model is produced. Experimental
observation of the predicted effects should be possible in BEC formed by
several hundred atoms.
