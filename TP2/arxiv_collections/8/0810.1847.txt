We observe quantum interference of photons emitted by two continuously
laser-excited single ions, independently trapped in distinct vacuum vessels.
High contrast two-photon interference is observed in two experiments with
different ion species, calcium and barium. Our experimental findings are
quantitatively reproduced by Bloch equation calculations. In particular, we
show that the coherence of the individual resonance fluorescence light field is
determined from the observed interference.
