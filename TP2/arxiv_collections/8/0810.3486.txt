A MEMS-based sensing device is used to measure the normal and tangential
stress fields at the base of a rough elastomer film in contact with a smooth
glass cylinder in steady sliding. This geometry allows for a direct comparison
between the stress profiles measured along the sliding direction and the
predictions of an original \textit{exact} bidimensional model of friction. The
latter assumes Amontons' friction law, which implies that in steady sliding the
interfacial tangential stress is equal to the normal stress times a
pressure-independent dynamic friction coefficient $\mu_d$, but makes no further
assumption on the normal stress field. Discrepancy between the measured and
calculated profiles is less than 14% over the range of loads explored.
Comparison with a test model, based on the classical assumption that the normal
stress field is unchanged upon tangential loading, shows that the exact model
better reproduces the experimental profiles at high loads. However, significant
deviations remain that are not accounted for by either calculations. In that
regard, the relevance of two other assumptions made in the calculations, namely
(i) the smoothness of the interface and (ii) the pressure-independence of
$\mu_d$ is briefly discussed.
