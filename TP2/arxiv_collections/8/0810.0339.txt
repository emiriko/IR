Rates of depopulation by blackbody radiation (BBR) and effective lifetimes of
alkali-metal \textit{nS}, \textit{n}P and \textit{nD} Rydberg states have been
calculated in a wide range of principal quantum numbers $n \le 80$ at the
ambient temperatures of 77, 300 and 600 K. Quasiclassical formulas were used to
calculate the radial matrix elements of the dipole transitions from Rydberg
states. Good agreement of our numerical results with the available theoretical
and experimental data has been found. We have also obtained simple analytical
formulas for estimates of effective lifetimes and BBR-induced depopulation
rates, which well agree with the numerical data.
