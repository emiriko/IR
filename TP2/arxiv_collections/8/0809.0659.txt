The quantum logical and quantum information-theoretic traditions have exerted
an especially powerful influence on Bub's thinking about the conceptual
foundations of quantum mechanics. This paper discusses both the quantum logical
and information-theoretic traditions from the point of view of their
representational frameworks. I argue that it is at this level, at the level of
its framework, that the quantum logical tradition has retained its centrality
to Bub's thought. It is further argued that there is implicit in the quantum
information-theoretic tradition a set of ideas that mark a genuinely new
alternative to the framework of quantum logic. These ideas are of considerable
interest for the philosophy of quantum mechanics, a claim which I defend with
an extended discussion of their application to our understanding of the
philosophical significance of the no hidden variable theorem of Kochen and
Specker.
