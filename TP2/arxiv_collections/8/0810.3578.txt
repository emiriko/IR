In this paper we compute Hochschild homology of certain Soergel bimodules.
Moreover, we describe explicitly the graded bimodule maps between Soergel
bimodules. This computations are motivated by the categorifications of the
colored HOMFLY-PT polynomial for links via Hochschild homology of Soergel
bimodules.
