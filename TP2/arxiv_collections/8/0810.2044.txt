By investigating the nonlinear propagation of high intensity electromagnetic
(EM) waves in a pair ion plasma, whose symmetry is broken via contamination by
a small fraction of high mass immobile ions, it is shown that this new and
interesting state of (laboratory created) matter is capable of supporting
structures that strongly localize and bunch the EM radiation with density
excess in the region of localization. Testing of this prediction in controlled
laboratory experiments can lend credence, inter alia, to conjectures on
structure formation (via the same mechanism) in the MEV era of the early
universe.
