We derive topological string amplitudes on local Calabi-Yau manifolds in
terms of polynomials in finitely many generators of special functions. These
objects are defined globally in the moduli space and lead to a description of
mirror symmetry at any point in the moduli space. Holomorphic ambiguities of
the anomaly equations are fixed by global information obtained from boundary
conditions at few special divisors in the moduli space. As an illustration we
compute higher genus orbifold Gromov-Witten invariants for C^3/Z_3 and C^3/Z_4.
