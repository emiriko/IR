A large body of work has been devoted to defining and identifying clusters or
communities in social and information networks. We explore from a novel
perspective several questions related to identifying meaningful communities in
large social and information networks, and we come to several striking
conclusions. We employ approximation algorithms for the graph partitioning
problem to characterize as a function of size the statistical and structural
properties of partitions of graphs that could plausibly be interpreted as
communities. In particular, we define the network community profile plot, which
characterizes the "best" possible community--according to the conductance
measure--over a wide range of size scales. We study over 100 large real-world
social and information networks. Our results suggest a significantly more
refined picture of community structure in large networks than has been
appreciated previously. In particular, we observe tight communities that are
barely connected to the rest of the network at very small size scales; and
communities of larger size scales gradually "blend into" the expander-like core
of the network and thus become less "community-like." This behavior is not
explained, even at a qualitative level, by any of the commonly-used network
generation models. Moreover, it is exactly the opposite of what one would
expect based on intuition from expander graphs, low-dimensional or
manifold-like graphs, and from small social networks that have served as
testbeds of community detection algorithms. We have found that a generative
graph model, in which new edges are added via an iterative "forest fire"
burning process, is able to produce graphs exhibiting a network community
profile plot similar to what we observe in our network datasets.
