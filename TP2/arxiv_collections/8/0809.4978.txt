Pulsed laser deposition was employed to grow thin films of the Heusler
compounds Co_2MnSi and Co_2FeSi. Epitaxial growth was realized both directly on
MgO (100) and on a Cr or Fe buffer layer. Structural analysis by x-ray and
electron diffraction shows for both materials the ordered L2_1 structure. Bulk
magnetization was determined with a SQUID magnetometer. The values agree with
the Slater-Pauling rule for half-metallic Heusler compounds. On the films grown
directly on the substrate measurements of the Hall effect have been performed.
The normal Hall effect is nearly temperature independent and points towards a
compensated Fermi surface. The anomalous contribution is found to be dominated
by skew scattering. A remarkable sign change of both normal and anomalous Hall
coefficients is observed on changing the valence electron count from 29 (Mn) to
30 (Fe).
