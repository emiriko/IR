We have started the development of a detector system, sensitive to single
photons in the eV energy range, to be suitably coupled to one of the CAST
magnet ports. This system should open to CAST a window on possible detection of
low energy Axion Like Particles emitted by the sun. Preliminary tests have
involved a cooled photomultiplier tube coupled to the CAST magnet via a
Galileian telescope and a switched 40 m long optical fiber. This system has
reached the limit background level of the detector alone in ideal conditions,
and two solar tracking runs have been performed with it at CAST. Such a
measurement has never been done before with an axion helioscope. We will
present results from these runs and briefly discuss future detector
developments.
