We formulate and numerically simulate the single control qubit Shor algorithm
for the case of static imperfections induced by residual couplings between
qubits. This allows us to study the accuracy of Shor's algorithm with respect
to these imperfections using numerical simulations of realistic quantum
computations with up to $n_q=18$ computational qubits allowing to factor
numbers up to N=205193. We confirm that the algorithm remains operational up to
a critical coupling strength $\epsilon_c$ which drops only polynomially with
$\log_2 N$. The obtained numerical dependence of $\epsilon_c$ on $\log_2 N$ is
in a good agreement with the analytical estimates that allows to obtain the
scaling for functionality of Shor's algorithm on realistic quantum computers
with a large number of qubits.
