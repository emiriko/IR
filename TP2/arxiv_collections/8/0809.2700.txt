We have used the electromigration technique to fabricate a
  $\rm{C_{{60}}}$ single-molecule transistor (SMT). We present a full
experimental study as a function of temperature, down to 35 mK, and as a
function of magnetic field up to 8 T in a SMT with odd number of electrons,
where the usual spin-1/2 Kondo effect occurs, with good agreement with theory.
In the case of even number of electrons, a low temperature magneto-transport
study is provided, which demonstrates a Zeeman splitting of the zero-bias
anomaly at energies well below the Kondo scale.
