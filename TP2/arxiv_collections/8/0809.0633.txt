Non-equilibrium collective behavior of self-propelled colloidal rods in a
confining channel is studied using Brownian dynamics simulations and dynamical
density functional theory. We observe an aggregation process in which rods
self-organize into transiently jammed clusters at the channel walls. In the
early stage of the process, fast-growing hedgehog-like clusters are formed
which are largely immobile. At later stages, most of these clusters dissolve
and mobilize into nematized aggregates sliding past the walls.
