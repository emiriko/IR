We are designing an all-scintillator Compton gamma imager for use in security
investigations and remediation actions involving radioactive threat material.
To satisfy requirements for a rugged and portable instrument, we have chosen
solid scintillator for the active volumes of both the scatter and absorber
detectors. Using the BEAMnrc/EGSnrc Monte Carlo simulation package, we have
constructed models using four different materials for the scatter detector:
LaBr_3, NaI, CaF_2 and PVT. We have compared the detector performances using
angular resolution, efficiency, and image resolution. We find that while PVT
provides worse performance than that of the detectors based entirely on
inorganic scintillators, all of the materials investigated for the scatter
detector have the potential to provide performance adequate for our purposes.
