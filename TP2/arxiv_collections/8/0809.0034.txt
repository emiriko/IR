Quantum random walks have received much interest due to their non-intuitive
dynamics, which may hold the key to a new generation of quantum algorithms.
What remains a major challenge is a physical realization that is experimentally
viable and not limited to special connectivity criteria. We present a scheme
for walking on arbitrarily complex graphs, which can be realized using a
variety of quantum systems such as a BEC trapped inside an optical lattice.
This scheme is particularly elegant since the walker is not required to
physically step between the nodes; only flipping coins is sufficient.
