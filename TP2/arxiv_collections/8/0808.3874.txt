Analytical and numerical calculations for a reduced Fermi-Pasta-Ulam chain
demonstrate that energy localization does not require more than one conserved
quantity. Clear evidence for the existence of a sharp
delocalization-localization transition at a critical amplitude is given.
Approaching the critical amplitude from above and below, diverging time scales
occur. Above the critical amplitude, the energy packet converges towards a
discrete breather. Nevertheless, ballistic energy transportation is present,
demonstrating that its existence does not necessarily imply delocalization.
