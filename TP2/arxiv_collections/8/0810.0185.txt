We apply topological methods to the study of the set of harmonic solutions of
periodically perturbed autonomous ordinary differential equations on
differentiable manifolds, allowing the perturbing term to contain a fixed
delay.
  In the crucial step, in order to cope with the delay, we define a suitable
(infinite dimensional) notion of Poincar\'e $T$-translation operator and prove
a formula that, in the unperturbed case, allows the computation of its fixed
point index.
