The $\mu\nu$SSM is a supersymmetric standard model that solves the $\mu$
problem of the MSSM using the R-parity breaking couplings between the
right-handed neutrino superfields and the Higgses in the superpotential,
$\lambda_{i} \hat \nu^c_i \hat H_d \hat H_u$. The $\mu$ term is generated
spontaneously through sneutrino vacuum expectation values, $\mu=\lambda_i <
\tilde \nu^c_i>$, once the electroweak symmetry is broken. In addition, the
couplings $\kappa_{ijk} \hat \nu^c_i\hat \nu^c_j\hat \nu^c_k$ forbid a global
U(1) symmetry avoiding the existence of a Goldstone boson, and also contribute
to spontaneously generate Majorana masses for neutrinos at the electroweak
scale. Following this proposal, we have analysed in detail the parameter space
of the $\mu\nu$SSM. In particular, we have studied viable regions avoiding
false minima and tachyons, as well as fulfilling the Landau pole constraint. We
have also computed the associated spectrum, paying special attention to the
mass of the lightest Higgs. The presence of right and left-handed sneutrino
vacuum expectation values leads to a peculiar structure for the mass matrices.
The most important consequence is that neutralinos are mixed with neutrinos,
and neutral Higgses with sneutrinos.
