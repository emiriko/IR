This thesis is dedicated to the holographic study of flavor dynamics. The
technique employed is a D7-brane probing of various D3-brane backgrounds. The
first topic covered studies the influence of an external magnetic field on a
flavored large N Yang-Mills theory. The theory exhibits spontaneous chiral
symmetry breaking. The meson spectrum exhibits Zeeman splitting and
characteristic GMOR relation. The second topic examines thermal properties of
the dual gauge theory. The third topic studies the phase structure of the
finite temperature dual gauge theory in the presence of magnetic field. A phase
diagram of the theory is obtained and the meson spectrum is explored. The
fourth topic studies the addition of an external electric field. The observed
effect is dissociation of the bound quarks, favoring the meson melting, the
dissociation of mesons corresponds to an insulator/conductor phase transition.
The fifth topic studies the addition of an R-charge chemical potential via
brane probing of the spinning D3-brane geometry. The corresponding phase
diagram is obtained. The chemical potential favors the dissociation of mesons.
The last topic explores universal properties of gauge theories dual to the
Dp/Dq system. A universal discrete self-similar behavior associated to the
insulator/conductor phase transition is observed and the corresponding scaling
exponents are computed.
