ADAPT is a tool that aims at easing the task of evaluating dependability
measures in the context of modern model driven engineering processes based on
AADL (Architecture Analysis and Design Language). Hence, its input is an AADL
architectural model annotated with dependability-related information. Its
output is a dependability evaluation model in the form of a Generalized
Stochastic Petri Net (GSPN). The latter can be processed by existing
dependability evaluation tools, to compute quantitative measures such as
reliability, availability, etc.. ADAPT interfaces OSATE (the Open Source AADL
Tool Environment) on the AADL side and SURF-2, on the dependability evaluation
side. In addition, ADAPT provides the GSPN in XML/XMI format, which represents
a gateway to other dependability evaluation tools, as the processing techniques
for XML files allow it to be easily converted to a tool-specific GSPN.
