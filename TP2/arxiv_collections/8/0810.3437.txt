By comparing the Q-values for the 46Ti(3He,t)46V and 47Ti(3He,t)47}V
reactions to the isobaric analog states the Q-value for the superallowed
Fermi-decay of 46V has been determined as Q_{EC}(46V)=(7052.11+/-0.27) keV. The
result is compatible with the values from two recent direct mass measurements
but is at variance with the previously most precise reaction Q-value. As
additional input quantity we have determined the neutron separation energy
S_n(47Ti)=(8880.51+/-0.25) keV.
