I describe how superstring theory may violate spin-statistics in an
experimentally observable manner. Reviewing the basics of superstring
interactions and how to utilize these to produce a statistical phase, I then
apply these ideas to two specific examples. The first is the case of heterotic
worldsheet linkings, whereby one small closed string momentarily enlarges
sufficiently to pass over another, producing such a statistical phase. The
second is the braneworld model with noncommutative geometry, whereby matter
composed of open strings may couple to a background in which spacetime
coordinates do not commute, modifying the field (anti)commutator algebra. I
conclude with ways to sharpen and experimentally test these exciting avenues to
possibly verify superstring theory.
