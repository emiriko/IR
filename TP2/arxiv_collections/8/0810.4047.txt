The production of electron-positron pairs from vacuum by counterpropagating
laser beams of linear polarization is calculated. In contrast to the usual
approximate approach, the spatial dependence and magnetic component of the
laser field are taken into account. We show that the latter strongly affects
the creation process at high laser frequency: the production probability is
reduced, the kinematics is fundamentally modified, the resonant
Rabi-oscillation pattern is distorted and the resonance positions are shifted,
multiplied and split.
