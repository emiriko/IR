Recently, it has been shown that spin nematic (quadrupolar) or higher
multipolar correlation functions exhibit a quasi long-range order in the wide
region of the field-induced Tomonaga-Luttinger-liquid (TLL) phase in spin-1/2
zigzag chains. In this paper, we point out that the temperature dependence of
the NMR relaxation rate 1/T_1 in these multipolar TLLs is qualitatively
different from that in more conventional TLLs of one-dimensional quantum
magnets (e.g., the spin-1/2 Heisenberg chain); 1/T_1 decreases with lowering
temperature in multipolar TLL. We also discuss low-energy features in spin
dynamical structure factors which are characteristic of the multipolar TLL
phases.
