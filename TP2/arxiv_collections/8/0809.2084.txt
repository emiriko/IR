We introduce a Sherrington-Kirkpatrick spin-glass model with the addition of
elastic degrees of freedom. The problem is formulated in terms of an effective
four-spin Hamiltonian in the pressure ensemble, which can be treated by the
replica method. In the replica-symmetric approximation, we analyze the
pressure-temperature phase diagram, and obtain expressions for the critical
boundaries between the disordered and the ordered (spin-glass and
ferromagnetic) phases. The second-order para-ferromagnetic border ends at a
tricritical point, beyond which the transition becomes discontinuous. We use
these results to make contact with the temperature-concentration phase diagrams
of mixtures of hydrogen-bonded crystals.
