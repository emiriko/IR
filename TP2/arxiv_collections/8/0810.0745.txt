Interactions among selfish users sharing a common transmission channel can be
modeled as a non-cooperative game using the game theory framework. When selfish
users choose their transmission probabilities independently without any
coordination mechanism, Nash equilibria usually result in a network collapse.
We propose a methodology that transforms the non-cooperative game into a
Stackelberg game. Stackelberg equilibria of the Stackelberg game can overcome
the deficiency of the Nash equilibria of the original game. A particular type
of Stackelberg intervention is constructed to show that any positive payoff
profile feasible with independent transmission probabilities can be achieved as
a Stackelberg equilibrium payoff profile. We discuss criteria to select an
operating point of the network and informational requirements for the
Stackelberg game. We relax the requirements and examine the effects of
relaxation on performance.
