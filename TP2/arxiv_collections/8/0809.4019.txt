This work studies the throughput scaling laws of ad hoc wireless networks in
the limit of a large number of nodes. A random connections model is assumed in
which the channel connections between the nodes are drawn independently from a
common distribution. Transmitting nodes are subject to an on-off strategy, and
receiving nodes employ conventional single-user decoding. The following results
are proven:
  1) For a class of connection models with finite mean and variance, the
throughput scaling is upper-bounded by $O(n^{1/3})$ for single-hop schemes, and
$O(n^{1/2})$ for two-hop (and multihop) schemes.
  2) The $\Theta (n^{1/2})$ throughput scaling is achievable for a specific
connection model by a two-hop opportunistic relaying scheme, which employs
full, but only local channel state information (CSI) at the receivers, and
partial CSI at the transmitters.
  3) By relaxing the constraints of finite mean and variance of the connection
model, linear throughput scaling $\Theta (n)$ is achievable with Pareto-type
fading models.
