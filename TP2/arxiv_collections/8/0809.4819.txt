A modified (Anti-)de Sitter Schwarzschild black hole solution is presented in
the framework of rainbow gravity with a cosmological constant. Its
thermodynamical properties are investigated. In general the temperature of
modified black holes is dependent on the energy of probes which take the
measurement. However, a notion of intrinsic temperature can be introduced by
identifying these probes with radiation particles emitted from black holes. It
is interesting to find that the Hawking temperature of this sort of black holes
can be reproduced by employing the extended uncertainty principle and modified
dispersion relations to the ordinary (A)dS Schwarzschild black holes.
