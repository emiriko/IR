The nature of the gapped ground state in the quasi-one-dimensional compound
eta-Na9V14O35 cannot easily be understood, if one takes into account the odd
number of spins on each structural element. Combining the results of specific
heat, susceptibility and electron spin resonance measurements we show that
eta-Na9V14O35 exhibits a novel ground state where multi-spin objects build up a
linear chain. These objects - pentamers - consist of five antiferromagnetically
arranged spins with effective spin 1/2. Their spatial extent results in an
exchange constant along the chain direction comparable to the one in the
high-temperature state.
