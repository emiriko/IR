Many key algorithms in 3-manifold topology involve the enumeration of normal
surfaces, which is based upon the double description method for finding the
vertices of a convex polytope. Typically we are only interested in a small
subset of these vertices, thus opening the way for substantial optimization.
Here we give an account of the vertex enumeration problem as it applies to
normal surfaces, and present new optimizations that yield strong improvements
in both running time and memory consumption. The resulting algorithms are
tested using the freely available software package Regina.
