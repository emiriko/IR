We present a study of quantum corrections to the conductivity of thin
ferromagnetic gadolinium films. In situ magneto-transport measurements were
performed on a series of thin films with thickness d < 135A. For sheet
resistances R0 < 4011 Ohm and temperatures T < 30K, we observe a linear
temperature dependence of the conductivity in addition to the logarithmic
temperature dependence expected from well known quantum corrections in two
dimensions. We show that such a linear T-dependence can arise from a spin-wave
mediated Altshuler-Aronov type correction.
