We report on a new type of optical nonlinearity in a polariton p-i-n
microcavity. Abrupt switching between the strong and weak coupling regime is
induced by controlling the electric field within the cavity. As a consequence
bistable cycles are observed for low optical powers (2-3 orders of magnitude
less than for Kerr induced bistability). Signatures of switching fronts
propagating through the whole 300 microns x 300 microns mesa surface are
evidenced.
