We study the effect of Coulomb interactions in transition metal oxides
junctions. In this paper we analyze charge transfer at the interface of a three
layer ferromagnetic-paramagnetic-ferromagnetic metallic oxide system. We choose
a charge model considering a few atomic planes within each layer and obtain
results for the magnetic coupling between the ferromagnetic layers. For large
number of planes in the paramagnetic spacer we find that the coupling
oscillates with the same period as in RKKY but the amplitude is sensitive to
the Coulomb energy. At small spacer thickness however, large differences may
appear as function of : the number of electrons per atom in the ferromagnetics
and paramagnetics materials, the dielectric constant at each component, and the
charge defects at the interface plane emphasizing the effects of charge
transfer.
