Recent results from the NA48/1 and NA48/2 experiments at the CERN SPS are
presented. NA48/2 carried out data taking in 2003 and 2004 collecting charged
kaon decays: branching ratios and form factors have been measured for the rare
K+- to pi+-e+e-, K+- to pi+-gammagamma and K+- to pi+-e+e-gamma decays. The
NA48/1 experiment has taken data in 2002 using only the Ks beam at an increased
intensity measuring neutral hyperon radiative decays. Using this data, which
exceeds present statistics by about one order of magnitude, a new precise
measurement of the Csi_0 decay asymmetries has been obtained.
