The transient dynamics of long overlap Josephson junctions in the frame of
the sine-Gordon model with a white noise source is investigated. The effect of
noise delayed decay is observed for the case of overdamped sine-Gordon
equation. It is shown that this noise induced effect, in the range of small
noise intensities, vanishes for junctions lengths greater than several
Josephson penetration length.
