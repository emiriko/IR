In the framework of the new t-dependence of the General Parton Distributions
(GPDs), which reproduce the electromagnetic form factors of the proton and
neutron at small and large momentum transfer, the gravitational form factors of
the nucleons and a separate contribution of the quarks to them are obtained.
