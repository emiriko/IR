The wave-particle alpha-channeling effect is generalized to include rotating
plasma. Specifically, radio frequency waves can resonate with alpha particles
in a mirror machine with ExB rotation to diffuse the alpha particles along
constrained paths in phase space. Of major interest is that the alpha-particle
energy, in addition to amplifying the RF waves, can directly enhance the
rotation energy which in turn provides additional plasma confinement in
centrifugal fusion reactors. An ancillary benefit is the rapid removal of alpha
particles, which increases the fusion reactivity.
