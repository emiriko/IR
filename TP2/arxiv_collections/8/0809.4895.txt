The double-spinor formalism, proposed by Aisaka and Kazama, provides a basis
for the pure-spinor formalism, which allows manifestly super-Poincare covariant
quantization of superstrings. We extend it to the case of backgrounds realized
by coset superspaces. A general method constructing reparametrization invariant
action is given using two concrete examples, the flat space-time and
AdS(5)xS(5). We find that it is natural to double not only the spinor
coordinates but the whole superspace for describing double-spinor superstrings
on such backgrounds. The reparametrization invariant action has local
symmetries compensating those extra degrees of freedom, which guarantee the
equivalence to the Green-Schwarz formalism.
