We study a natural generalization of the additivity problem in quantum
information theory: given a pair of quantum channels, then what is the set of
convex trace functions that attain their maximum on unentangled inputs, if they
are applied to the corresponding output state?
  We prove several results on the structure of the set of those convex
functions that are "additive" in this more general sense. In particular, we
show that all operator convex functions are additive for the Werner-Holevo
channel in 3x3 dimensions, which contains the well-known additivity results for
this channel as special cases.
