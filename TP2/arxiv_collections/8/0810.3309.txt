I will describe recent results from the HPQCD collaboration using a new very
accurate method for charm quarks in lattice QCD, that we have used in
calculations including the full effect of u, d and s sea quarks. Multiple
values of the lattice spacing and of the u, d and s sea quark masses allow us
to extrapolate reliably, with a full error budget, to the real world. This
opens up the field of charm physics to precision lattice QCD tests. So far we
have calculated the D and D_s meson masses to 6 MeV, having fixed the charm
quark mass from the eta_c meson. Our D and D_s decay constants (determined to
2%) make an interesting comparison to CLEO-c results as we await improved
experimental errors. We are also able to determine the charm quark mass to an
accuracy of 1% using charmonium correlators and high-order continuum QCD
perturbation theory. Future calculations are briefly discussed.
