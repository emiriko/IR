We observe oscillatory magnetoresistance in double quantum wells under
microwave irradiation. The results are explained in terms of the influence of
subband coupling on the frequency-dependent photoinduced part of the electron
distribution function. As a consequence, the magnetoresistance demonstrates the
interference of magneto-intersubband oscillations and conventional microwave-
induced resistance oscillations.
