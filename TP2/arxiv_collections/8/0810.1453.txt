The ATLAS and CMS detectors can be used to search for heavy long-lived
particles which might signal physics beyond the Standard Model. Such new states
can be distinguished from Standard Model particles by exploiting their unique
signatures, ranging from multi-leptons and/or jets pro- duction anywhere within
the detector volume, to minimum ionizing particles with low velocity and high
momentum. Here are reviewed the strategies proposed by ATLAS and CMS to search
for these signals, with particular emphasis on possible challenges to the
trigger and detector operations.
