On the basis of a dynamical Relativistic Mean Field (RMF) model we study the
response of a nucleus on the antiproton implanted in its interior. We solve the
Vlasov equation for the antiproton-nuclear system and show assuming a
moderately attractive antiproton optical potential that the compressed state is
formed on a rather short time scale of about 4-10 fm/c. The evolution of the
system after antiproton annihilation is simulated using the Giessen
Boltzmann-Uehling-Uhlenbeck (GiBUU) transport model. Finally, several sensitive
observables to the antiproton annihilation in a compressed nuclear
configuration are proposed, e.g. the nucleon kinetic energy spectra and the
total invariant mass distributions of produced mesons.
