The process of electroproduction of the electron-positron pair by high energy
electron in an oriented single crystal is investigated. Two contributions are
considered: the direct (one-step) process via the virtual intermediate photon
and the cascade(two-step) process when the electron emits the real photon
moving in the field of axis and afterwards the photon converts into the pair.
The spectrum of created positron(electron) is found. It is shown that the
probability of the process is strongly enhanced comparing with the
corresponding amorphous medium.
