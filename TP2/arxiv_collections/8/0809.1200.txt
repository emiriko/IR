We outline a program with the potential to solve both the cosmological
constant and quantum gravity problems within a single, comprehensive framework,
one that is formulated entirely in four spacetime dimensions. The program is
based on an interplay between the dynamical symmetry breaking of particle
physics and a gravity theory, conformal gravity, which possesses an underlying
local conformal invariant structure. Central to the discussion is the
recognition that when symmetry is broken dynamically in a conformal invariant
theory, the cosmological constant is both induced by and constrained by
zero-point fluctuations. We describe what still needs to be done.
