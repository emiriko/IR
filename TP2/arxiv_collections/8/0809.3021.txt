We construct an adaptive asymptotically optimal in the classical norm of the
space L(2) of square integrable functions non - parametrical multidimensional
time defined signal regaining (adaptive filtration, noise canceller) on the
background noise via multidimensional truncated Legendre expansion and optimal
experience design. The two - dimensional case is known as a picture processing,
picture analysis or image processing. We offer a two version of an confidence
region building, also adaptive. Our estimates proposed by us have successfully
passed experimental tests on problem by simulate of modeled with the use of
pseudo-random numbers as well as on real data (of seismic signals etc.) for
which our estimations of the different signals were compared with classical
estimates obtained by the kernel or wavelets estimations method. The precision
of proposed here estimations is better. Our adaptive truncation may be used
also for the signal and image compression.
