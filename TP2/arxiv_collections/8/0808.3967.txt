We report on the observation of five Feshbach resonances in collisions
between ultracold $^7$Li and $^{87}$Rb atoms in the absolute ground state
mixture where both species are in their $|f,m_f>=|1,1>$ hyperfine states. The
resonances appear as trap losses for the $^7$Li cloud induced by inelastic
heteronuclear three-body collisions. The magnetic field values where they occur
are important quantities for an accurate determination of the interspecies
interaction potentials. Results of coupled channels calculations based on the
observed resonances are presented and refined potential parameters are given. A
very broad Feshbach resonance centered around 649 G should allow for fine
tuning of the interaction strength in future experiments.
