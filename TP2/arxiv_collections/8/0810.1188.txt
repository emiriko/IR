In the Dimension Embedded in Unified Symmetry (Adrian Sabin Popescu, D.E.U.S.
(Dimension Embedded in Unified Symmetry), p. 221-247, Ed. Cartea Universitara,
Bucuresti, ISBN 978-973-731-519-9 (arXiv:0704.2670) (2007)) book we made a
qualitative description of the way in which we can construct the Large Scale
Structure of the Universe from the knot-particle equivalence. Even that we are
limited by the lack of computational power implemented on a nonlinear
computational architecture needed to conduct this study to its finish, we are
still able to give the algorithm to be used in a future simulation, on a, let
say, quantum computer.
