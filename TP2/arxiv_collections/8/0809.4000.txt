I make some critical comments on the article "An experimental test of
non-local realism", by S. Groblacher, T. Paterek, R. Kaltenbaek, C. Brukner, M.
Zukowski, M. Aspelmeyer, & A. Zeilinger, Nature 446, p. 871-875 (2007). This
article makes incorrect claims concerning Bell's theorem. Moreover, I point to
the fact that a hypothesis referred to as "realism" in the article (Groblacher
et al.) is not used in the deduction of Leggett's inequality.
