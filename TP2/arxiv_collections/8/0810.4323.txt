The relations between production and perception in 4-year-old children were
examined in a study of compensation strategies for a lip-tube perturbation.
Acoustic and perceptual analyses of the rounded vowel [u] produced by twelve
4-year-old French speakers were conducted under two conditions: normal and with
a 15-mm-diameter tube inserted between the lips. Recordings of isolated vowels
were made in the normal condition before any perturbation (N1), immediately
upon insertion of the tube and for the next 19 trials in this perturbed
condition, with (P2) or without articulatory instructions (P1), and in the
normal condition after the perturbed trials (N2). The results of the acoustic
analyses reveal speaker-dependent alterations of F1, F2, and/or F0 in the
perturbed conditions and after the removal of the tube. For some subjects, the
presence of the tube resulted in very little change; for others, an increase in
F2 was observed in P1, which was generally reduced in some of the 20
repetitions, but not systematically and not continuously. The use of
articulatory instructions provided in the P2 condition was detrimental to the
achievement of a good acoustic target. Perceptual data are used to determine
optimal combinations of F0, F1, and F2 (in Bark) related to these patterns. The
data are compared to a previous study conducted with adults [Savariaux et al.,
J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 106, 381-393 (1999)].
