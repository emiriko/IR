The Phi-factory DAFNE was upgraded in the second half of 2007 in order to
implement a recently proposed scheme of crab waist collisions aimed at
substantial luminosity increase. Commissioning of the modified collider started
in November 2007. In this paper we briefly describe the crab waist collision
concept and discuss in detail the DAFNE hardware upgrade and obtained
experimental results.
