In this brief note, by applying the stochastic approach to multiple fields,
we estimate the probability of tunneling between vacua in a landscape with
$\cal N$ fields. We find that the probability can be enhanced by large $\cal
N$. When $\cal N$ saturates the dS entropy of some vacuum, the corresponding
vacuum will be extremely unstable and be expected to rapidly decay. We discuss
the implications of this result.
