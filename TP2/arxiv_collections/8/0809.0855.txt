The local structure of the manifolds named in the title is described.
Although curvature homogeneous, they are not, in general, locally homogeneous.
Not all of them are Ricci-flat, which answers an existence question about type
III Jordan-Osserman metrics, raised by Diaz-Ramos, Garcia-Rio and
Vazquez-Lorenzo (2006).
