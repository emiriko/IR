A good fit of the fermion masses and mixings has been found in the minimal
renormalizable supersymmetric SO(10). This solution needs a strongly split
supersymmetry breaking scenario with gauginos and higgsinos around 100 TeV,
sfermions close to 10^14 GeV and a low GUT scale of around 6 10^15 GeV. We
predict fast proton decays through SO(10) type of d=6 operators and the
leptonic mixing angle theta_13 approximately 0.1.
