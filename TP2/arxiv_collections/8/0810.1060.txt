We describe the deconfining critical temperature dependence on the pion mass
and on the isospin chemical potential in remarkably good agreement with lattice
data. Our framework incorporates explicit dependence on quark masses, isospin
and baryonic chemical potentials for the case of two flavors through
ingredients from well-known high- and low-energy theories. In the low-energy
sector, the system is described by a minimal chiral perturbation theory
effective action, corresponding to a hot gas of pion quasiparticles and heavy
nucleons. For the high-temperature sector we adopt a simple extension of the
fuzzy bag model. We also briefly discuss the effects of mass asymmetry and
baryon chemical potential.
