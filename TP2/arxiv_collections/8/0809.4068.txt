We investigate the anisotropic quantum orbital compass model on an infinite
square lattice by means of the infinite projected entangled-pair state
algorithm. For varying values of the $J_x$ and $J_z$ coupling constants of the
model, we approximate the ground state and evaluate quantities such as its
expected energy and local order parameters. We also compute adiabatic time
evolutions of the ground state, and show that several ground states with
different local properties coexist at $J_x = J_z$. All our calculations are
fully consistent with a first order quantum phase transition at this point,
thus corroborating previous numerical evidence. Our results also suggest that
tensor network algorithms are particularly fitted to characterize first order
quantum phase transitions.
