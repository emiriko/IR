Applying the G_{2(2)} generating technique for minimal D=5 supergravity to
the Rasheed black hole solution, we present a new rotating charged Kaluza-Klein
black hole solution to the five-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell-Chern-Simons
equations. At infinity, our solution behaves as a four-dimensional flat
spacetime with a compact extra dimension and hence describes a Kaluza-Klein
black hole. In particlar, the extreme solution is non-supersymmetric, which is
contrast to a static case. Our solution has the limits to the asymptotically
flat charged rotating black hole solution and a new charged rotating black
string solution.
