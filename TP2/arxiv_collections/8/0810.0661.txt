In this article, I review the recent results for inclusive and exclusive
measurements for $b\to s\gamma$ and $b\to d\gamma$ decays from $B$ factories
Belle and Babar. I describe the measurement of branching fraction and direct CP
violating asymmetry for inclusive $B\to X_s\gamma$ decay. For results of $b\to
d\gamma$ process, I introduce the measurement of branching fraction of
exclusive $b\to d\gamma$ modes, the first measurement for CP asymmetry of $b\to
d\gamma$ process using $B\to\rho\gamma$ mode, and semi-inclusive measurement
for $B\to X_d\gamma$.
