We compute the electronic component of the thermal conductivity (TC) and the
thermoelectric power (TEP) of monolayer graphene, within the hydrodynamic
regime, taking into account the slow rate of carrier population imbalance
relaxation. Interband electron-hole generation and recombination processes are
inefficient due to the non-decaying nature of the relativistic energy spectrum.
As a result, a population imbalance of the conduction and valence bands is
generically induced upon the application of a thermal gradient. We show that
the thermoelectric response of a graphene monolayer depends upon the ratio of
the sample length to an intrinsic length scale l_Q, set by the imbalance
relaxation rate. At the same time, we incorporate the crucial influence of the
metallic contacts required for the thermopower measurement (under open circuit
boundary conditions), since carrier exchange with the contacts also relaxes the
imbalance. These effects are especially pronounced for clean graphene, where
the thermoelectric transport is limited exclusively by intercarrier collisions.
For specimens shorter than l_Q, the population imbalance extends throughout the
sample; the TC and TEP asymptote toward their zero imbalance relaxation limits.
In the opposite limit of a graphene slab longer than l_Q, at non-zero doping
the TC and TEP approach intrinsic values characteristic of the infinite
imbalance relaxation limit. Samples of intermediate (long) length in the doped
(undoped) case are predicted to exhibit an inhomogeneous temperature profile,
whilst the TC and TEP grow linearly with the system size. In all cases except
for the shortest devices, we develop a picture of bulk electron and hole number
currents that flow between thermally conductive leads, where steady-state
recombination and generation processes relax the accumulating imbalance.
