We show quantitatively that tiny amounts of copolymer that decorate a
oil/water interfaces can greatly enhance the stability of swollen surfactant
hexagonal phases, comprising oil tubes regularly arranged in a water matrix.
Such soft composite materials, whose both radius of the tubes and water channel
between the tubes can be controlled independently over large ranges, offer a
potential interest for the synthesis of mesoporous materials.
