The aim of this paper is to analyze different regulation mechanisms in
spatial continuous stochastic development models. We describe the density
behavior for models with global mortality and local establishment rates. We
prove that the local self-regulation via a competition mechanism (density
dependent mortality) may suppress a unbounded growth of the averaged density if
the competition kernel is superstable.
