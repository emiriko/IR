First-principle electronic structure calculations have been performed in
crystalline complex phases mu-Al4Mn and lambda-Al4Mn using the TB-LMTO method.
These atomic structures, related to quasicrystalline structures, contain about
560 atoms in a large hexagonal unit cell. One of the main characteristic of
their density of states is the presence of fine peaks the so-called "spiky
structure". From multiple-scattering calculations in real space, we show that
these fine peaks are not artifacts in ab-initio calculations, since they result
from a specific localization of electrons by atomic clusters of different
length scales.
