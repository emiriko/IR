In a 2004 article, Udo Baumgartner and George Willis used ideas from the
structure theory of totally disconnected, locally compact groups to achieve a
better understanding of the contraction group U_f associated with an
automorphism f of such a group G, assuming that G is metrizable. (Recall that
U_f consists of all group elements x such that f^n(x) tends to the identity
element as n tends to infinity). Recently, Wojciech Jaworski showed that the
main technical tool of the latter article remains valid in the non-metrizable
case. He asserted without proof that, therefore, all results from that article
remain valid. However, metrizability enters the arguments at a second point. In
this note, we resolve this difficulty, by providing an affirmative answer to a
question posed by Willis in 2004.
