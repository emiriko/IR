Applying the Hamilton-Jacobi method beyond the semiclassical approximation
prescribed in \cite{Majhi3} for the scalar particle, Hawking radiation as
tunneling of Dirac particle through an event horizon is analysed. We show that,
as before, all quantum corrections in the single particle action are
proportional to the usual semiclassical contribution. We also compute the
modifications to the Hawking temperature and Bekenstein-Hawking entropy for the
Schwarzschild black hole. Finally, the coefficient of the logarithmic
correction to entropy is shown to be related with the trace anomaly.
