Ultrasound velocity measurements of cubic spinel GeCo$_2$O$_4$ in single
crystal were performed for the investigation of shear and compression moduli.
The shear moduli in the paramagnetic state reveal an absence of Jahn-Teller
activity despite the presence of orbital degeneracy in the Co$^{2+}$ ions. Such
a Jahn-Teller inactivity indicates that the intersite orbital-orbital
interaction is much stronger than the Jahn-Teller coupling. The compression
moduli in the paramagnetic state near the N$\acute{e}$el temperature $T_N$
reveal that the most relevant exchange path for the antiferromagnetic
transition lies in the [111] direction. This exchange-path anisotropy is
consistent with the antiferromagnetic structure with the wave vector $q
\parallel$ [111], suggesting the presence of bond frustration due to
competition among a direct ferromagnetic and several distant-neighbors
antiferromagnetic interactions. In the JT-inactive condition, the bond
frustration can be induced by geometrical orbital frustration of
$t_{2g}$-$t_{2g}$ interaction between the Co$^{2+}$ ions which can be realized
in the pyrochlore lattice of the high spin Co$^{2+}$ with $t_{2g}$-orbital
degeneracy. In GeCo$_2$O$_4$, the tetragonal elongation below $T_N$ releases
the orbital frustration by quenching the orbital degeneracy.
