A simulation model is presented, comprising elastic spheres with a short
range attraction. Besides conservative forces, radial- and shear friction, and
radial noise are added. The model can be used to simulate colloids, granular
solids and powders, and the parameters may be related to experimental systems
via the range of attraction and the adhesion energy. The model shares the
simplicity and speed of Dissipative Particle Dynamics (DPD), yet the
predictions are rather non-trivial. We demonstrate that the model predicts the
correct scaling relations for fracture of granular solids, and we present a
schematic phase diagram. This shows liquid-vapor coexistence for sufficiently
large interaction range, with a surface tension that follows Ising criticality.
For smaller interaction range only solid-vapor coexistence is found, but for
very small attractive interaction range stable liquid-vapor coexistence
reappears due to pathological stability of the solid phase. At very low
temperature the model forms a glassy state.
