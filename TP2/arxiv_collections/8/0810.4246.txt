The expression for the electromagnetic field of a charge moving along an
arbitrary trajectory is obtained in a direct, elegant, and Lorentz invariant
manner without resorting to more complicated procedures such as differentiation
of the Lienard-Wiechert potentials. The derivation uses arguments based on
Lorentz invariance and a physically transparent expression originally due to
J.J.Thomson for the field of a charge that experiences an impulsive
acceleration.
