Let $ G $ be a discrete subgroup of PU(1,n). Then $ G $ acts on $\mathbb
{P}^n_\mathbb C$ preserving the unit ball $\mathbb {H}^n_\mathbb {C}$, where it
acts by isometries with respect to the Bergman metric. In this work we
determine the equicontinuty region $Eq(G)$ of $G$ in $\mathbb P^n_{\mathbb C}$:
It is the complement of the union of all complex projective hyperplanes in
$\mathbb {P}^n_{\mathbb C}$ which are tangent to $\partial \mathbb
{H}^n_\mathbb {C}$ at points in the Chen-Greenberg limit set $\Lambda_{CG}(G
)$, a closed $G$-invariant subset of $\partial \mathbb {H}^n_\mathbb {C}$,
which is minimal for non-elementary groups. We also prove that the action on
$Eq(G)$ is discontinuous.
