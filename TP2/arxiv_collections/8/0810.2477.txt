Let~$A$ be a quotient of $J_0(N)$ associated to a newform $f$ such that the
special $L$-value of $A$ (at $s=1$) is non-zero. We give a formula for the
ratio of the special $L$-value to the real period of $A$ that expresses this
ratio as a rational number. We extract an integer factor from the numerator of
this formula; this factor is non-trivial in general and is related to certain
congruences of $f$ with eigenforms of positive analytic rank. We use the
techniques of visibility to show that, under certain hypotheses (which includes
the first part of the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture on rank), if an odd
prime $q$ divides this factor, then $q$ divides either the order of the
Shafarevich-Tate group or the order of a component group of $A$. Suppose $p$ is
an odd prime such that $p^2$ does not divide $N$, $p$ does not divide the order
of the rational torsion subgroup of $A$, and $f$ is congruent modulo a prime
ideal over $p$ to an eigenform whose associated abelian variety has positive
Mordell-Weil rank. Then we show that $p$ divides the factor mentioned above; in
particular, $p$ divides the numerator of the ratio of the special $L$-value to
the real period of $A$. Both of these results are as implied by the second part
of the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture, and thus provide theoretical
evidence towards the conjecture.
