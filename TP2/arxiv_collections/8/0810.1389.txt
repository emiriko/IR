Event Shape Data from $e^+e^-$ annihilation into hadrons collected by the
JADE experiment at centre-of-mass energies between 14 GeV and 44 GeV are used
to determine the strong coupling $\alpha_S$. QCD predictions complete to
next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO), alternatively combined with resummed
next-to-leading-log-approximation (NNLO+NLLA) calculations, are used. The
combined value from six different event shape observables at the six JADE
centre-of-mass energies using the NNLO calculations is
  $\alpha_S(M_Z)$= 0.1210 +/- 0.0007(stat.) +/- 0.0021(expt.) +/- 0.0044(had.)
+/- 0.0036(theo.) and with the NNLO+NLLA calculations the combined value is
$\alpha_S$= 0.1172 +/- 0.0006(stat.) +/- 0.0020(expt.) +/- 0.0035(had.) +/-
0.0030(theo.) . The stability of the NNLO and NNLO+NLLA results with respect to
missing higher order contributions, studied by variations of the
renormalisation scale, is improved compared to previous results obtained with
NLO+NLLA or with NLO predictions only. The observed energy dependence of
$\alpha_S$ agrees with the QCD prediction of asymptotic freedom and excludes
absence of running with 99% confidence level.
