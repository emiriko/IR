The bipartite quantum teleportation with a three-qubit mixture of GHZ and W
states as a quantum channel is discussed. When the quantum channel is a mixed
state consisting of the GHZ state plus small perturbed W state, the
entanglement of the channel becomes zero when the average fidelity
$\bar{F}_{GHZ}$ is less than 0.775. This means that the mixed state cannot play
an any role as a quantum channel at $\bar{F}_{GHZ} \leq 0.775$. For the case of
the mixed state consisting of the W state plus small perturbed GHZ state it
turn out that this mixed state cannot play a role as a quantum channel at
$\bar{F}_W \leq 0.833$.
