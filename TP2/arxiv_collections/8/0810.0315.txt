I present three recent results from searches for exotic physics at the
BaBar/PEP-II B-factory. These results span many of the samples produced at the
B-factory, including B mesons, tau leptons, and Upsilon(3S) mesons. We have
searched for CPT-violation in B mixing and find no significant deviation from
the no-violation hypothesis. We have also searched for lepton-flavor-violating
decays of the tau using tau- -> omega l- and tau- -> l+ l- l+ and their charge
conjugates. We find no evidence for these processes and set upper limits on
their branching fractions. Finally, we have searched for a low-mass Higgs boson
in the decay Upsilon(3S) -> gamma A0, where the Higgs decays invisibly. We find
no evidence for such a decay and set upper limits across a range of possible
Higgs masses.
