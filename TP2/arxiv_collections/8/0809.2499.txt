The temperature dependence of the interlayer electrical and thermal
resistivity in a layered metal are calculated for Fermi liquid quasiparticles
which are scattered inelastically by two-dimensional antiferromagnetic spin
fluctuations. Both resistivities have a linear temperature dependence over a
broad temperature range. Extrapolations to zero temperature made from this
linear-$T$ range give values that appear to violate the Wiedemann-Franz law.
However, below a low-temperature scale, which becomes small close to the
critical point, a recovery of this law occurs. Our results describe recent
measurements on CeCoIn$_5$ near a magnetic field-induced quantum phase
transition. Hence, the experiments do not necessarily imply a non-Fermi liquid
ground state.
