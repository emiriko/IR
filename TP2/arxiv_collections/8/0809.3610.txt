A computational study of morphological instabilities of a two-dimensional
nematic front under directional growth was performed using a Landau-de Gennes
type quadrupolar tensor order parameter model for the first-order
isotropic/nematic transition of 5CB (pentyl-cyanobiphenyl). A previously
derived energy balance, taking anisotropy into account, was utilized to account
for latent heat and an imposed morphological gradient in the time-dependent
model. Simulations were performed using an initially homeotropic
isotropic/nematic interface. Thermal instabilities in both the linear and
non-linear regimes were observed and compared to past experimental and
theoretical observations. A sharp-interface model for the study of linear
morphological instabilities, taking into account additional complexity
resulting from liquid crystalline order, was derived. Results from the
sharp-interface model were compared to those from full two-dimensional
simulation identifying the specific limitations of simplified sharp-interface
models for this liquid crystal system. In the nonlinear regime, secondary
instabilities were observed to result in the formation of defects, interfacial
heterogeneities, and bulk texture dynamics.
