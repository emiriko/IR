We investigate two-component ultracold fermionic atoms with repulsive
interactions trapped in an optical lattice with a ladder structure. By applying
the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations to an effective t-J model in the strong
correlation limit, we discuss how the spatially-modulated spin-singlet pairs
with d-wave like symmetry are formed in the systems with trapping potentials.
Furthermore, a close examination of the condensation energy as well as the
local average of potential, kinetic and exchange energies by means of the
variational Monte Carlo method elucidates that local particle correlations
enhance the stability of the superfluid state via substantial energy gain due
to singlet pairing in the high particle density region.
