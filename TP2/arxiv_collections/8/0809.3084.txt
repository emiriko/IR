Ternary Ba-Fe-As system has been studied to determine a primary
solidification field of the BaFe$_2$As$_2$ phase. We found that the
BaFe$_2$As$_2$ phase most likely melts congruently and primarily solidifies
either in the FeAs excess or Ba$_{x}$As$_{100-x}$ excess liquid. Knowing the
primary solidification field, we have performed the vertical Bridgman growth
using the starting liquid composition of Ba$_{15}$Fe$_{42.5}$As$_{42.5}$. Large
single crystals of the typical size 10x4x2 mm$^3$ were obtained and their
quality was confirmed by X-ray Laue and neutron diffraction.
