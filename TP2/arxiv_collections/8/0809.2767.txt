We present evidence of the existence of a new supersymmetric quartet of
nuclei in the A=190 mass region. The analysis is based on new experimental
information on the odd-odd nucleus 194Ir from transfer and capture reactions.
The new data allow the identification of a new supersymmetric quartet,
consisting of the 192,193Os and 193,194Ir nuclei. We make explicit predictions
fo r193Os, and suggest that its spectroscopic properties be measured in
dedicated experiments. Finally, we study correlations between different
transfer reactions.
