The formulation of the low-momentum effective interaction in the model space
Lee-Suzuki and the renormalization group methods is implemented in the
three-dimensional approach. In this approach the low-momentum effective
interaction V_{low k} has been formulated as a function of the magnitude of
momentum vectors and the angle between them. As an application the spin-isospin
independent Malfliet-Tjon potential has been used into the model space
Lee-Suzuki method and it has been shown that the low-momentum effective
interaction V_{low k} reproduces the same two-body observables obtained by the
bare potential V_{NN}.
