In this paper we study the low temperature kinetics of the electrons in the
system composed of a quantum dot connected to two leads by solving the equation
of motion. The decoherence and the relaxation of the system caused by the gate
voltage noise and electron-phonon scattering are investigated. In order to take
account of the strong correlation of the electrons in this system, the
quasi-exact wave functions are calculated using an improved matrix product
states algorithm. This algorithm enables us to calculate the wave functions of
the ground state and the low lying excited states with satisfied accuracy and
thus enables us to study the kinetics of the system more effectively. It is
found that although both of these two mechanisms are proportional to the
electron number operator in the dot, the kinetics are quite different. The
noise induced decoherence is much more effective than the energy relaxation,
while the energy relaxation and decoherence time are of the same order for the
electron-phonon scattering. Moreover, the noise induced decoherence increases
with the lowering of the dot level, but the relaxation and decoherence due to
the electron-phonon scattering decrease.
