We determine chiral loop corrections to the B meson decay amplitudes to
positive and negative parity charmed mesons within a framework which combines
heavy quark and chiral symmetries. We find that corrections due to states of
opposite parity are competitive with the contributions arising from K and eta
meson loops. Since lattice studies rely on the chiral behavior of the
amplitudes we discuss the chiral limit of our results. We also comment on the
extraction of 1/m_B, 1/m_D subleading form factors relevant for the studies of
B_q to D_q tau nu decays, which are sensitive to possible helicity-suppressed
new physics contributions.
