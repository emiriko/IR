A model-independent global search for new physics has been performed at the
CDF experiment. This search examines 399 final states, looking for
discrepancies between observation and the standard model expectation in
populations, kinematic shapes, bumps in mass distributions suggestive of new
resonances and the tails of the summed transverse momentum distribution. This
global search reveals no evidence of physics beyond the Standard Model in 2.0
fb^-1 of p-pbar collisions at sqrt(s)=1.96 TeV.
