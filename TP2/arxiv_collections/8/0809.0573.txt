We stress the relevance of the two features of translational invariance and
atomic nature of the gas in the quantum description of the motion of a massive
test particle in a gas, corresponding to the original picture of Einstein used
in the characterization of Brownian motion. The master equation describing the
reduced dynamics of the test particle is of Lindblad form and complies with the
requirement of covariance under translations.
