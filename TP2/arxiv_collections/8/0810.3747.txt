We report on searches for a standard model (SM) Higgs boson in $p\bar(p)$
collisions at a center of mass energy sqrt{s}=1.96 TeV with the CDF and D0
detectors using an integrated luminosity of more than 3.0/fb. For a SM Higgs
with mass greater than 135 GeV, the dominant decay mode is two W bosons and the
searches presented are based upon the subsequent electron and muon decays of
the two W bosons. Significant improvement in background modeling and signal
predictions have been implemented since previous preliminary results. No
significant excess is observed, and limits on standard model Higgs production
are calculated. The observed 95% confidence level upper limits are found to be
a factor of 1.63 (2.0) higher than the predicted SM cross section at m_H = 165
GeV for the CDF (D0) experiment while the expected limits are a factor of 1.66
(1.9) higher than the predicted SM cross section.
