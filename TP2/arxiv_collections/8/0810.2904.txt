In this work our previous fully differential ionization cross section
calculations using the semiclassical, impact parameter method are improved by a
new method suitable to calculate impact parameter values corresponding to
different momentum transfers. This goal is achieved by two successive steps.
First, using the transverse momentum balance different projectile scattering
angles are calculated for the binary and recoil peak regions as a function of
the transferred momentum. Then, by treating the projectile scattering as a
classical potential scattering problem, impact parameters are assigned to these
scattering angles. The new method, which no longer contains empirical
considerations, is tested calculating by fully differential ionization cross
sections for single ionization of helium produced by fast C$^{6+}$ ions.
