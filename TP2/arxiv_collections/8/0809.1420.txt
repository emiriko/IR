The influence of a Zeeman magnetic field on the superconducting
characteristics of the attractive Hubbard model was investigated. The ground
state and temperature phase diagrams were obtained for a fixed number of
particles. Two critical magnetic fields were found for the first order phase
transition from the superconducting to the normal state for $n\neq 1$. For some
range of parameters a reentrant transition was found and gapless
superconductivity was obtained. The significance of the Hartree term was also
analyzed.
