We analyze the geometry of rational p-division points in degenerating
families of elliptic curves in characteristic p. We classify the possible
Kodaira symbols and determine for the Igusa moduli problem the reduction type
of the universal curve. Special attention is paid to characteristic 2 and 3
where wild ramification and stacky phenomena show up.
