One- and two-layer graphene have recently been shown to feature new physical
phenomena such as unconventional quantum Hall effects and prospects of
supporting a non-silicon technological platform using epitaxial graphene. While
both one- and two-layer graphene have been studied extensively, continuous
sheets of graphene possessing both parts have not yet been explored. Here we
report a study of such graphene hybrid structures. In a bulk hybrid featuring
two large-area one- and two-layer graphene and an interface between them, two
sets of Landau levels and features related to the interface were found. In edge
hybrids featuring a large two-layer graphene with narrow one-layer graphene
edges, we observed an anomalous suppression in quantum oscillation amplitude
due to the locking of one- and two-layer graphene Fermi energies and emergent
chiral interface states. These findings demonstrate the importance of these
hybrid structures whose unique interface states and related phenomena deserve
further studies.
