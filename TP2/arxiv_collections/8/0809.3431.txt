The moments of the heavy quark-parton distribution functions in a heavy
pseudoscalar meson, obtained in QCD sum rules, are expanded in the inverse
heavy quark. Comparison with the finite mass results reveals that while the
heavy mass expansion works reasonably well for the $b$ quark, one has to take
into account terms of higher than $(1/m_c)^2$ order for the $c$ quark.
