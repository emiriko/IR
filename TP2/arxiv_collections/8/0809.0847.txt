We examine theoretic architectures and an abstract model for a restricted
class of quantum computation, called here instantaneous quantum computation
because it allows for essentially no temporal structure within the quantum
dynamics. Using the theory of binary matroids, we argue that the paradigm is
rich enough to enable sampling from probability distributions that cannot,
classically, be sampled from efficiently and accurately. This paradigm also
admits simple interactive proof games that may convince a skeptic of the
existence of truly quantum effects. Furthermore, these effects can be created
using significantly fewer qubits than are required for running Shor's
Algorithm.
