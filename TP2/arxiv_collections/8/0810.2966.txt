We present preliminary measurements of time-dependent CP-violation parameters
in the decays B0->omegaK0S, B0->eta'K0, B0->pi0K0S, B0->phiK0Spi0, and
B0->K+K-K0S, which includes the resonant final states phiK0S and f0(980)K0S.
The data sample corresponds to the full BABAAR dataset of 467 million BBbar
pairs produced at the PEP-II asymmetric-energy e+e- collider at the Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center.
