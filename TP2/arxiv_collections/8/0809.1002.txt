We present a novel norm preserving stochastic evolution equation for a Bose
field. Ensemble averages are quantum expectation values in the canonical
ensemble. This numerically very stable equation suppresses high-energy
fluctuations exponentially, preventing cutoff problems to occur. We present 3D
simulations for an ideal gas in various trapping potentials focussing on ground
state occupation numbers and spatial correlation functions for a wide range of
temperatures above and below the critical temperature. Although rigorously
valid for non-interacting Bosons only, we argue that weakly interacting Bose
gases may also be amenable to this approach, in the usual mean-field
approximation.
