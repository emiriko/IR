We display a continous equation for the deconvolution process that
generalizes the Van Cittert algorithm in the case of oceanic boundary
conditions for a given fixed wind. We deduce a LES model for which we have
existence and uniqueness of a strong solution. Finally, we display several
numerical simulations showing the practical interest of the model.
