Undoped GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructures have been used to fabricate quantum
wires in which the average impurity separation is greater than the device size.
We compare the behavior of the Zero-Bias Anomaly against predictions from Kondo
and spin polarization models. Both theories display shortcomings, the most
dramatic of which are the linear electron-density dependence of the Zero-Bias
Anomaly spin-splitting at fixed magnetic field B and the suppression of the
Zeeman effect at pinch-off.
