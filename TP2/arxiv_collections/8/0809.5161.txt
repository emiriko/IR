It has recently been discovered that for certain rates of mode-exchange
collisions analytic solutions can be found for a Hamiltonian describing the
two-mode Bose-Einstein condensate. We proceed to study the behavior of the
system using perturbation theory if the coupling constants only approximately
match these parameter constraints. We find that the model is robust to such
perturbations. We study the effects of degeneracy on the perturbations and find
that the induced changes differ greatly from the non-degenerate case. We also
model inelastic collisions that result in particle loss or condensate decay as
external perturbations and use this formalism to examine the effects of
three-body recombination and background collisions.
