The four-dimensional model with topological mass generation that was found by
Dvali, Jackiw and Pi has recently been generalized to any even number of
dimensions (2n-dimensions) in a nontrivial manner in which a Stueckelberg-type
mass term is introduced [S. Deguchi and S. Hayakawa, Phys. Rev. D 77, 045003
(2008), arXiv:0711.1446]. The present paper deals with a self-contained model,
called here a modified hybrid model, proposed in this 2n-dimensional
generalization and considers the canonical formalism for this model. For the
sake of convenience, the canonical formalism itself is studied for a model
equivalent to the modified hybrid model by following the recipe for treating
constrained Hamiltonian systems. This formalism is applied to the canonical
quantization of the equivalent model in order to clarify observable and
unobservable particles in the model. The equivalent model (with a gauge-fixing
term) is converted to the modified hybrid model (with a corresponding
gauge-fixing term) in a Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin (BRST)-invariant manner.
Thereby it is shown that the Chern-Pontryagin density behaves as an observable
massive particle (or field). The topological mass generation is thus verified
at the quantum-theoretical level.
