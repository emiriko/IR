We report a fast, room temperature detection scheme for the polarization
ellipticity of laser radiation, with a bandwidth that stretches from the
infrared to the terahertz range. The device consists of two elements, one in
front of the other, that detect the polarization ellipticity and the azimuthal
angle of the ellipse. The elements respectively utilise the circular
photogalvanic effect in a narrow gap semiconductor and the linear photogalvanic
effect in a bulk piezoelectric semiconductor. For the former we characterized
both a HgTe quantum well and bulk Te, and for the latter, bulk GaAs. In
contrast with optical methods our device is an easy to handle all-electric
approach, which we demonstrated by applying a large number of different lasers
from low power, continuous wave systems to high power, pulsed sources.
