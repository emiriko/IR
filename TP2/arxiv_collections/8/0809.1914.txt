We propose a scheme to demonstrate the electromagnetically induced
transparency (EIT) in a system of a superconducting Cooper-pair box coupled to
a nanomechanical resonator. In this scheme, the nanomechanical resonator plays
an important role to contribute additional auxiliary energy levels to the
Cooper-pair box so that the EIT phenomenon could be realized in such a system.
We call it here resonator-assisted induced transparency (RAIT). This RAIT
technique provides a detection scheme in a real experiment to measure physical
properties, such as the vibration frequency and the decay rate, of the coupled
nanomechanical resonator.
