We check claims for a generalized central limit theorem holding at the
Feigenbaum (infinite bifurcation) point of the logistic map, made recently by
U. Tirnakli, C. Beck, and C. Tsallis (Phys. Rev. {\bf 75}, 040106(R) (2007)).
We show that there is no obvious way that these claims can be made consistent
with high statistics simulations. We also refute more recent claims by the same
authors that extend the claims made in the above reference.
