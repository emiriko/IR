We prove sharp Strichartz estimates for the semi-classical Schrodinger
equation on a compact manifold with smooth, strictly geodesically concave
boundary. We deduce sharp (classical) Strichartz estimates for the Schrodinger
equation outside a strictly convex obstacle, local existence for the
H^1-critical (quintic) Schrodinger equation and scattering for the sub-critical
Schrodinger equation in 3D.
