This is the second article in which we study the rotating Morse potential
model for diatomic molecules using the tridiagonal J-matrix approach. Here, we
improve further the accuracy of computing the bound states and resonance
energies for this potential model from the poles of the S-matrix for arbitrary
angular momentum. The calculation is performed using an infinite square
integrable basis that supports a tridiagonal matrix representation for the
reference Hamiltonian, which is included in the computations analytically
without truncation. Our method has been applied to both the regular and
inverted Morse potential with favorable results in comparison with available
numerical data. We have also shown that the present method adds few significant
digits to the accuracy obtained from the finite dimensional approach (e.g. the
complex rotation method). Moreover, it allows us to handle easily both analytic
and non-analytic potentials as well as 1/r singular potentials.
