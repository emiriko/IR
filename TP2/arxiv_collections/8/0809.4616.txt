The classical limit of quantum mechanics is discussed for closed quantum
systems in terms of observational aspects. Initially, the failure of the limit
h->0 is explicitly demonstrated in a model of two quantum mechanically
interacting oscillators by showing that neither quantum expectations reduce to
Newtonian trajectories nor entanglement vanishes. This result suggests that the
quantum-to-classical transition occurs only at an approximative level, which is
regulated by the low accuracy of the measurements. In order to verify the
consistence of these ideas we take into account the experimental resolution of
physical measurements by introducing a discretized formulation for the quantum
structure of wave functions. As a result, in the low-resolution limit the
quasi-determinism is recovered and hence the quantum-to-classical transition is
shown to occur adequately. Other puzzling problems, such as the classical limit
of quantum superpositions and nonlocal correlations, are naturally address as
well.
