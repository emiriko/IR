The low-energy effective theories describing string compactifications in the
presence of fluxes are so-called gauged supergravities: deformations of the
standard abelian supergravity theories. The deformation parameters can be
identified with the various possible (geometric and non-geometric) flux
components. In these lecture notes we review the construction of gauged
supergravities in a manifestly duality covariant way and illustrate the
construction in several examples.
