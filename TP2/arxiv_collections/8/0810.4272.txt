We applied soft X-ray absorption spectroscopy to study the Ti L-edge in
ferroelectric capacitors using a modified total electron yield method. The
inner photo currents and the X-ray absorption spectra were polarization state
dependent. The results are explained on the basis of photo electric effects and
the inner potential in the ferroelectric capacitors as a result of back-to-back
Schottky barriers superimposed by the potential due to the depolarization
field. In general, the presented method offers the opportunity to investigate
the electronic structure of buried metal-insulator and metal-semiconductor
interfaces in thin film devices. Corresponding author:
