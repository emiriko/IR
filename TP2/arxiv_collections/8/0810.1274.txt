Recently E. Harrison has argued the Red Shift distance law proposed by Hubble
and velocity-distance law developed later on theoretical grounds has no general
proof demonstrating the two laws are actually equivalent. It is the purpose of
this paper to account for the nebular redshift law of Hubble based on two
principles: 1) Spacetime motion and light dragging. 2) An overall spacetime
index of refraction based on Hubble's Constant.
