The LHC experiments are close to collecting data and one of their first tasks
is to test the electro-weak sector of the Standard Model. In this talk an
overview of first physics measurements with events containing W and Z bosons is
presented, such as the W and Z production cross-sections. Emphasis will be
given to data-driven approaches used to extract trigger and lepton
reconstruction efficiencies and to reject backgrounds.
