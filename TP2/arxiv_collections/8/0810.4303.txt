We study charged Higgs production in the process $\gamma\gamma\to A^0\to W^-
H^+$. The processes $\gamma\gamma\to A^0$ are loop mediated in a 2HDM. This is
due to the fact that photons only couple directly to charged particles and the
Higgs only couples to particles with mass acquired via Higgs mechanism.
Although in MSSM the contribution from the process $\gamma\gamma\to A^0$ is too
small, it has been found that in a more general 2HDM it could be enhanced. On
the other hand, the boson $A^0$ can decay in $W^- H^+$ at tree level and the
charged Higgs can decay in fermions. So, the whole process under study is
$\gamma\gamma\to A^0\to (W^-\to l\nu) (H^+\to f_if_j)$ in 2HDM-III. Evidence
about charged Higgs existence could demonstrate that structure of the Higgs
sector has several multiplets.
