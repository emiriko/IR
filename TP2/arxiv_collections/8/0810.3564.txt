The asymptotic capacity at low input powers of an average-power limited or an
average- and peak-power limited discrete-time Poisson channel is considered.
For a Poisson channel whose dark current is zero or decays to zero linearly
with its average input power $E$, capacity scales like $E\log\frac{1}{E}$ for
small $E$. For a Poisson channel whose dark current is a nonzero constant,
capacity scales, to within a constant, like $E\log\log\frac{1}{E}$ for small
$E$.
