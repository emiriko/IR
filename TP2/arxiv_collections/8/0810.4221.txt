Disordered systems are an important class of models in statistical mechanics,
having the defining characteristic that the energy landscape is a fixed
realization of a random field. Examples include various models of glasses and
polymers. They also arise in other areas, like fitness models in evolutionary
biology. The ground state of a disordered system is the state with minimum
energy. The system is said to be chaotic if a small perturbation of the energy
landscape causes a drastic shift of the ground state. We present a rigorous
theory of chaos in disordered systems that confirms long-standing physics
intuition about connections between chaos, anomalous fluctuations of the ground
state energy, and the existence of multiple valleys in the energy landscape.
Combining these results with mathematical tools like hypercontractivity, we
establish the existence of the above phenomena in eigenvectors of GUE matrices,
the Kauffman-Levin model of evolutionary biology, directed polymers in random
environment, a subclass of the generalized Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model of
spin glasses, the discrete Gaussian free field, and continuous Gaussian fields
on Euclidean spaces. We also list several open questions.
