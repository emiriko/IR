The construction of two electron linacs and an optical FEL system is
proposed. This facility, which would serve primarily as a Higgs-boson collider
factory, could be built in two stages, each with distinct physics objectives
requiring particular center-of-mass (CM) energies: (1) e+e- -> HZ (E_ee ~ 250
GeV), and (2) gamma-gamma -> H, HH (E_ee ~ 160 to 320 GeV). The rich set of
final states in e+e- and gamma-gamma collisions would play an essential role in
measuring the mass, spin, parity, two-photon width and trilinear self-coupling
of the Higgs boson, as well as its couplings to fermions and gauge bosons;
these quantities are difficult to determine with only one initial state. All
the measurements made at LEP and SLC could be repeated using highly polarized
electron beams and at much higher luminosities. For some processes within and
beyond the Standard Model, the required CM energy is considerably lower at the
proposed facility than at an e+e- or proton collider.
