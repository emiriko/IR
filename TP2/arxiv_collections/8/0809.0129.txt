We study the shear-induced diffusion effect and the transition to
irreversibility in suspensions under oscillatory shear flow by performing an
analysis of the entropy production associated to the motion of the particles.
We show that the Onsager coupling between different contributions to the
entropy production is responsible for the scaling of the mean square
displacement on particle diameter and applied strain. We also show that the
shear-induced effective diffusion coefficient depends on the volume fraction
and use Lattice-Boltzmann simulations to characterize the effect through the
power spectrum of particle positions for different Reynolds numbers and volume
fractions. Our study gives a thermodynamic explanation of the the transition to
irreversibility through a pertinent analysis of the second law of
thermodynamics.
