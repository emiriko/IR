We consider the behavior of massive Dirac fields on the background of a
charged de-Sitter black hole. All black hole geometries are taken into account,
including the Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m-de-Sitter one, the Nariai case and the
ultracold case. Our focus is at first on the existence of bound quantum
mechanical states for the Dirac Hamiltonian on the given backgrounds. In this
respect, we show that in all cases no bound state is allowed, which amounts
also to the non-existence of normalizable time-periodic solutions of the Dirac
equation. This quantum result is in contrast to classical physics, and it is
shown to hold true even for extremal cases. Furthermore, we shift our attention
on the very interesting problem of the quantum discharge of the black holes.
Following Damour-Deruelle-Ruffini approach, we show that the existence of
level-crossing between positive and negative continuous energy states is a
signal of the quantum instability leading to the discharge of the black hole,
and in the cases of the Nariai geometry and of the ultracold geometries we also
calculate in WKB approximation the transmission coefficient related to the
discharge process.
