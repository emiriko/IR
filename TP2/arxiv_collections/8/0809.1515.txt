We report results of magneto-acoustic studies in the quantum spin-chain
magnet NiCl$_2$-4SC(NH$_2$)$_2$ (DTN) having a field-induced ordered
antiferromagnetic (AF) phase. In the vicinity of the quantum critical points
(QCPs) the acoustic $c_{33}$ mode manifests a pronounced softening accompanied
by energy dissipation of the sound wave. The acoustic anomalies are traced up
to $T > T_N$, where the thermodynamic properties are determined by fermionic
magnetic excitations, the "hallmark" of one-dimensional (1D) spin chains. On
the other hand, as established in earlier studies, the AF phase in DTN is
governed by bosonic magnetic excitations. Our results suggest the presence of a
crossover from a 1D fermionic to a 3D bosonic character of the magnetic
excitations in DTN in the vicinity of the QCPs.
