We demonstrate superluminal light propagation using two frequency multiplexed
pump beams to produce a gain doublet in a photorefractive crystal of Ce:BaTiO3.
The two gain lines are obtained by two-wave mixing between a probe field and
two individual pump fields. The angular frequencies of the pumps are
symmetrically tuned from the frequency of the probe. The frequency difference
between the pumps corresponds to the separation of the two gain lines; as it
increases, the crystal gradually converts from normal dispersion without
detuning to an anomalously dispersive medium. The time advance is measured as
0.28 sec for a pulse propagating through a medium with a 2Hz gain separation,
compared to the same pulse propagating through empty space. We also demonstrate
directly anomalous dispersion profile using a modfied experimental
configuration. Finally, we discuss how anomalous dispersion produced this way
in a faster photorefractive crystal (such as SPS: Sn2P2S6) could be employed to
enhance the sensitivity-bandwidth product of a LIGO type gravitational wave
detector augmented by a White Light Cavity.
