This paper is concerned with the numerical approximation of the isothermal
Euler equations for charged particles subject to the Lorentz force. When the
magnetic field is large, the so-called drift-fluid approximation is obtained.
In this limit, the parallel motion relative to the magnetic field direction
splits from perpendicular motion and is given implicitly by the constraint of
zero total force along the magnetic field lines. In this paper, we provide a
well-posed elliptic equation for the parallel velocity which in turn allows us
to construct an Asymptotic-Preserving (AP) scheme for the Euler-Lorentz system.
This scheme gives rise to both a consistent approximation of the Euler-Lorentz
model when epsilon is finite and a consistent approximation of the drift limit
when epsilon tends to 0. Above all, it does not require any constraint on the
space and time steps related to the small value of epsilon. Numerical results
are presented, which confirm the AP character of the scheme and its Asymptotic
Stability.
