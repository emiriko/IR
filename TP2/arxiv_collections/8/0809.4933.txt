In this paper, we investigate a curvature-adapted and proper complex
equifocal submanifold in a symmetric space of non-compact type. The class of
these submanifolds contains principal orbits of Hermann type actions as
homogeneous examples. In future, the results in this paper will be used to give
a submanifold geometrical characterization of principal orbits of Hermann type
actions.
