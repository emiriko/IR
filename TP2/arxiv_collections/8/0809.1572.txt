Recently, there have been many attempts to implement quantum computation
experimentally. For this purpose, quantum coherence should be maintained during
gate operations. Therefore, the control of decoherence is a very important
problem. In present study, we examine the decoherence of one-dimensional
electron system, which coupled with acoustic phonon. The time-dependent
Hatree-Fock approximation is applied for electron system, the Schroinger
equation is applied for phonon.The metal-insulator transition found for
coherence time. The results are the election interaction reduces the coherence
time. We also exmined the Bang-Bang control, the results shows recovery of
coherence.
