For $n\geq 3$, we study the Cauchy problem for the fourth order nonlinear
Schr\"{o}dinger equations, for which the existence of the scattering operators
and the global well-posedness of solutions with small data in Besov spaces
$B^{s}_{2,1}(\R^n)$ are obtained. In one spatial dimension, we get the global
well-posedness result with small data in the critical homogeneous Besov spaces
$\dot{B}^{s}_{2,1}$. As a by-product, the existence of the scattering operators
with small data is also obtained. In order to show these results, the global
version of the estimates for the maximal functions and the local smoothing
effects on the fourth order Schr\"{o}dinger semi-groups are established.
