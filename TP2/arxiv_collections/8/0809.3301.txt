We discuss the pattern of low energy sparticle spectra which appears in some
class of moduli stabilization scenario. In case that light moduli are
stabilized by non-perturbative effects encoded in the superpotential and a
phenomenologically viable de Sitter vacuum is obtained by a sequestered
supersymmetry breaking sector, the anomaly-mediated soft terms become
comparable to the moduli-mediated ones, leading to a quite distinctive pattern
of low energy spacticle masses dubbed the mirage mediation pattern. We also
discuss low energy sparticle masses in more general mixed-mediation scenario
which includes a comparable size of gauge mediation in addition to the moduli
and anomaly mediations.
