We introduce the concept of interpolation in quantum evolution and present a
general framework to find the energy optimal Hamiltonian for a quantum system
evolving among a given set of middle states using variational and geometric
methods. A few special cases are carefully studied. The quantum brachistochrone
problem is proved as a special case.
