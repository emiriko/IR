We introduce solvable stochastic dealer models, which can reproduce basic
empirical laws of financial markets such as the power law of price change.
Starting from the simplest model that is almost equivalent to a Poisson random
noise generator, the model becomes fairly realistic by adding only two effects,
the self-modulation of transaction intervals and a forecasting tendency, which
uses a moving average of the latest market price changes. Based on the present
microscopic model of markets, we find a quantitative relation with market
potential forces, which has recently been discovered in the study of market
price modeling based on random walks.
