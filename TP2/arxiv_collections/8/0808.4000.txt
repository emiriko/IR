The recent discovery that silicon nitride membranes can be used as extremely
high Q mechanical resonators makes possible a number of novel experiments,
which include improved long range vacuum Casimir force measurements, and
measurments of the properties of liquid helium below the lambda point. It is
noted that in the thermal correction to the Casimir force, the phase velocity
of the excitations does not enter, with the force per unit area between
parallel plates depending only on the temperature and distance between the
plates. Thus it appears as possible to measure the phonon analog of the finite
temperature Casimir force in liquid helium.
