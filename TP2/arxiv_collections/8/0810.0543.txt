The rate of the semileptonic decay b to c l v is calculated with order
alphas^2 accuracy, as an expansion around the limit of equal masses of the b
and c quarks. Recent results obtained around the limit of the c-quark much
lighter than b are confirmed. Details of the new expansion method are
described.
