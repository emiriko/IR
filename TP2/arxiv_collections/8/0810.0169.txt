A model based on the alternating structure of the imbedded conduction layers
(the Cu-O2 planes) with the charge-transfer-insulator (CTI) layers is proposed.
There are three kinds of carriers, each with a different behavior:
conduction-like holes in the Cu-O2 layers and electrons and normal holes in the
CTI matrix between the Cu-O2 layers. This structure explains the strong
anisotropies. The relationship is obtained between the concentration nq of
conduction-like holes in the Cu-O2 layers and the temperature T. The anomalous
temperature behavior of the resistivity as well as the Hall constant also
follows. We give the hole density in ab plane a definite physical meaning, and
also define explicitly optimal doping, overdoping and underdoping. Our model
gives the correct temperature dependence of the resistivity and the hole
constant on optimal doping, overdoping and underdoping, and it predicts the
temperature behavior of the cotangent of the Hall angle quite well. Based on
this model, we can also understand that the HiTc materials become "Fermi
Liquids" in the extremely overdoped region, and the dR/dT becomes negative
below some temperature T<1.211T0 in the underdoped case. Based on this model,
the thermal behaviors of the magnetic susceptibility in different doping can
also be easily explained. The resistivity along c-axis is discussed.
