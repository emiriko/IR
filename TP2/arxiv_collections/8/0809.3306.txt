This study considers implementations of error correction in a simulation
language on a classical computer. Error correction will be necessarily in
quantum computing and quantum information. We will give some examples of the
implementations of some error correction codes. These implementations will be
made in a more general quantum simulation language on a classical computer in
the language Mathematica. The intention of this research is to develop a
programming language that is able to make simulations of all quantum algorithms
and error corrections in the same framework. The program code implemented on a
classical computer will provide a connection between the mathematical
formulation of quantum mechanics and computational methods. This gives us a
clear uncomplicated language for the implementations of algorithms.
