In this talk I will review the present status and future perspectives of some
popular extensions of the conventional three-neutrino oscillation scenario,
from a purely phenomenological point of view. For concreteness I will focus
only on three specific scenarios: non-standard neutrino interactions with
matters, models with extra sterile neutrinos, and neutrino decay and
decoherence.
