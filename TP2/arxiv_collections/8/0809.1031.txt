We propose a practical way to overcome the ubiquitous problem of the
overestimation of the zero-bias and zero-temperature conductance, which is
associated to the use of local approximations to the exchange-correlation
functional in Density-Functional Theory when applied to quantum transport. This
is done through partial substitution of the local exchange term in the
functional by the nonlocal Hartree-Fock exchange. As a non-trivial example of
this effect we revisit the smallest molecular bridge studied so far: a Hydrogen
molecule placed in between Platinum nanocontacts. When applied to this system
the value of the conductance diminishes as compared to the local-exchange-only
value, which is in close agreement with results predicted from Time-Dependent
Current-Density-Functional Theory. Our results issue a warning message on
recent claims of perfect transparency of a Hydrogen molecule in Platinum
nanocontacts.
