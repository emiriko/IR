The deformation kinetics for glassy solid helium confined in microscopic
domain at very low temperature regime was investigated using a transition-rate
model considering the shear thinning behavior which means, once material being
subjected to high shear rates, the viscosity diminishes with increasing shear
rate. The preliminary results show that there might be nearly frictionless
fields for rate of deformation due to the almost vanishing shear stress in
microtubes at very low temperature regime subjected to some surface conditions
: The relatively larger roughness (compared to the macroscopic domain) inside
microtubes and the slip. As the pore size decreases, the surface-to-volume
ratio increases and therefore, surface roughness will greatly affect the
deformation kinetics in microtubes. By using the boundary perturbation method,
we obtained a class of temperature and activation energy dependent fields for
the deformation kinetics at low temperature regime with the presumed small wavy
roughness distributed along the walls of an cylindrical microtube. The critical
deformation kinetics of the glassy matter is dependent upon the temperature,
activation energy, activation volume, orientation dependent and is proportional
to the (referenced) shear rate, the slip length, the amplitude and the
orientation of the wavy-roughness. Finally, we also discuss the quantitative
similarity between our results with Ray and Hallock [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf
100}, 235301 (2008)].
