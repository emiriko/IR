Chaotic iterations have been introduced on the one hand by Chazan, Miranker
[5] and Miellou [9] in a numerical analysis context, and on the other hand by
Robert [11] and Pellegrin [10] in the discrete dynamical systems framework. In
both cases, the objective was to derive conditions of convergence of such
iterations to a fixed state. In this paper, a new point of view is presented,
the goal here is to derive conditions under which chaotic iterations admit a
chaotic behaviour in a rigorous mathematical sense. Contrary to what has been
studied in the literature, convergence is not desired.
  More precisely, we establish in this paper a link between the concept of
chaotic iterations on a finite set and the notion of topological chaos [8],
[6], [7]. We are motivated by concrete applications of our approach, such as
the use of chaotic boolean iterations in the computer security field. Indeed,
the concept of chaos is used in many areas of data security without real
rigorous theoretical foundations, and without using the fundamental properties
that allow chaos.
  The wish of this paper is to bring a bit more mathematical rigour in this
field.
