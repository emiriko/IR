We study the effects of thickness on the ground states of two-dimensional
quantum dots in high magnetic fields. To be specific, we assume the thickness
to be small so that only the lowest state in the corresponding direction is
occupied, but which however leads to a modification of the effective
interaction between the electrons. We find the ground state phase diagram and
demonstrate the emergence of new phases as the thickness is accounted for.
Finally, the wave functional form and vortex structure of different phases is
analyzed.
