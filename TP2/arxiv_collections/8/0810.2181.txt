We study quantum transport in honeycomb lattice ribbons with either armchair
or zigzag edges. The ribbons are coupled to semi-infinite linear chains serving
as the input and output leads and we use a tight-binding Hamiltonian with
nearest-neighbor hops. For narrow ribbons we find transmission gaps for both
types of edges. The center of the gap is at the middle of the band in ribbons
with armchair edges. This symmetry is due to a property satisfied by the
matrices in the resulting linear problem. In ribbons with zigzag edges the gap
center is displaced to the right of the middle of the band. We also find
transmission oscillations and resonances within the transmitting region of the
band for both types of edges. Extending the length of a ribbon does not affect
the width of the transmission gap, as long as the ribbon's length is longer
than a critical value when the gap can form. Increasing the width of the
ribbon, however, changes the width of the gap. In armchair edges the gap is not
well-defined because of the appearance of transmission resonances while in
zigzag edges the gap width systematically shrinks as the width of the ribbon is
increased. We also find only evanescent waves within the gap and both
evanescent and propagating waves in the transmitting regions.
