We provide lower and upper bounds on the information transmission capacity of
one single use of a classical-quantum channel. The lower bound is expressed in
terms of the Hoeffding capacity, that we define similarly to the Holevo
capacity, but replacing the relative entropy with the Hoeffding distance.
Similarly, our upper bound is in terms of a quantity obtained by replacing the
relative entropy with the recently introduced max-relative entropy in the
definition of the divergence radius of a channel.
