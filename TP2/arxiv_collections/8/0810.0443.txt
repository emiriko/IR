We continue our study of residual properties of mapping tori of free group
endomorphisms. In this paper, we prove that each of these groups are virtually
residually (finite $p$)-groups for all but finitely many primes$p$. The method
involves further studies of polynomial maps over finite fields and $p$-adic
completions of number fields.
