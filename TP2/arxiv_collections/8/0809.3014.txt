Recently S. Chmutov introduced a generalization of the dual of a ribbon (or
embedded) graph and proved a relation between Bollobas and Riordan's ribbon
graph polynomial of a ribbon graph and its generalized duals. Here I show that
the duality relation satisfied by the ribbon graph polynomial can be understood
in terms of knot theory and I give a simple proof of the relation via the
homfly polynomial of a knot.
