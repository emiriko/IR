We investigate interplay between magnetic fluctuations and superconductivity
in the effective five-band Hubbard model for iron-oxypnictide superconductors
on the basis of the fluctuation-exchange approximation. As for the normal-state
properties, we find the pseudogap behavior in the NMR relaxation rate and the
spectral weight in the electron-doped region, while we cannot find such
behavior in the hole-doped region. The pseudogap behavior originates from the
band structure effect, that is, existence of high density of states just below
the Fermi level.
  Solving the superconducting Eliashberg equation, we find that the most
probable candidate for the pairing symmetry is the sign-changed s-wave
spin-singlet state. For small Hund's coupling J, the eigenvalue is not so
sensitive to carrier doping, and seems to be irrelevant with antiferromagnetic
(AF) spin fluctuation. We suggest that correlation between spin and
spin-quadrupole is important as the pairing mechanism as well as the AF
fluctuation.
