Novel data from the $K^{-}_{stop}A$ absorption reaction in light nuclei
$^{6,7}$Li and $^{9}$Be are presented. The study aimed at finding $\Lambda t$
correlations. Regardless of $A$, the $\Lambda t$ pairs are preferentially
emitted in opposite directions. Reaction modeling predominantly assigns to the
$K^-_{stop}A\to\Lambda t(N)A'$ direct reactions the emission of the $\Lambda t$
pairs whose yield is found to range from $10^{-3}$ to $10^{-4}$$/K^-_{stop}$.
The experiment was performed with the FINUDA spectrometer at DA$\Phi$NE (LNF).
