I will review heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory for the nucleon delta
degrees of freedom and then examine the recent dynamical lattice calculations
of the nucleon mass from the BMW, ETM, JLQCD, LHP, MILC, NPLQCD, PACS-CS,
QCDSF/UKQCD and RBC/UKQCD Collaborations. Performing the chiral extrapolations
of these results, one finds remarkable agreement with the physical nucleon
mass, from each lattice data set. However, a careful examination of the lattice
data and the resulting extrapolation functions reveals some unexpected results,
serving to highlight the significant challenges in performing chiral
extrapolations of baryon quantities. All the N_f=2+1 dynamical results can be
quantitatively described by theoretically unmotivated fit function linear in
the pion mass with m_pi ~ 750 -190 MeV. When extrapolated to the physical
point, the results are in striking agreement with the physical nucleon mass. I
will argue that knowledge of each lattice datum of the nucleon mass is required
at the 1-2% level, including all systematics, in order to conclusively
determine if this is a bizarre conspiracy of lattice artifacts or rather a
mysterious phenomenon of QCD.
