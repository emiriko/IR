We consider $\ell$-Volterra quadratic stochastic operators defined on
$(m-1)$-dimensional simplex, where $\ell\in\{0,1,...,m\}$. Under some
conditions on coefficients of such operators we describe Lyapunov functions and
apply them to obtain upper estimates for the set of $\omega$- limit points of
trajectories. We describe a set of fixed points of $\ell$-Volterra operators.
