We consider backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs) related to
finite state, continuous time Markov chains. We show that appropriate solutions
exist for arbitrary terminal conditions, and are unique up to sets of measure
zero. We do not require the generating functions to be monotonic, instead using
only an appropriate Lipschitz continuity condition.
