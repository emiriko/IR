One of the goals of hypernuclear physics is to study the properties of
baryon-baryon interaction including the strangeness contribution. Double
hypernuclei can provide information about the $\Lambda\Lambda$ interaction in
addition to the hyperon-hyperon and hyperon-nucleus one. A new technique for
producing double hypernuclei using antiprotons is foreseen in the PANDA
experiment at FAIR. Gamma ray spectroscopy is a way to measure the hyperon pair
binding energy and the HPGe detectors can achieve the necessary resolution.
