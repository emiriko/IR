I propose implementing General Gauge Mediation using the class of $SU(N)
\times U(1)$ SUSY breaking models. As an existence proof, I have utilized the
4-1 model in building multi-parameter gauge mediation. These hidden sectors are
relatively easy to use and avoid several model building pitfalls such as
runaway directions. In addition models require no special tuning and may
produce as many parameters as general gauge mediation allows.
