We obtain an exact Green-Kubo type linear response result for the heat
current in an open system. The result is derived for classical Hamiltonian
systems coupled to heat baths. Both lattice models and fluid systems are
studied and several commonly used implementations of heat baths, stochastic as
well as deterministic, are considered. The results are valid in arbitrary
dimensions and for any system sizes. Our results are useful for obtaining the
linear response transport properties of mesoscopic systems. Also we point out
that for systems with anomalous heat transport, as is the case in
low-dimensional systems, the use of the standard Green-Kubo formula is
problematic and the open system formula should be used.
