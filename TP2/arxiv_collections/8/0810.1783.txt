We describe the consequences of time reversal invariance of the Stokes'
equations for the hydrodynamic scattering of two low Reynolds number swimmers.
For swimmers that are related to each other by a time reversal transformation
this leads to the striking result that the angle between the two swimmers is
preserved by the scattering. The result is illustrated for the particular case
of a linked-sphere model swimmer. For more general pairs of swimmers, not
related to each other by time reversal, we find hydrodynamic scattering can
alter the angle between their trajectories by several tens of degrees. For two
identical contractile swimmers this can lead to the formation of a bound state.
