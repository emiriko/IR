A sequence $(s_n)$ of integers is good for the mean ergodic theorem if for
each invertible measure preserving system $(X,\mathcal{B},\mu,T)$ and any
bounded measurable function $f$, the averages $ \frac1N \sum_{n=1}^N
f(T^{s_n}x)$ converge in the $L^2$ norm. We construct a sequence $(s_n)$ that
is good for the mean ergodic theorem, but the sequence $(s_n^2)$ is not.
Furthermore, we show that for any set of bad exponents $B$, there is a sequence
$(s_n)$ where $(s_n^k)$ is good for the mean ergodic theorem exactly when $k$
is not in $B$. We then extend this result to multiple ergodic averages. We also
prove a similar result for pointwise convergence of single ergodic averages.
