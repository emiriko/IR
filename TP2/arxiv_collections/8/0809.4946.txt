Deep inelastic scattering cross section measurements previously published by
the H1 and ZEUS collaborations are combined. The procedure takes into account
the systematic error correlations in a coherent way, leading to a significantly
reduced overall cross section uncertainty. The combined H1 and ZEUS
measurements of the inclusive neutral and charged current cross sections are
used to perform a common NLO QCD fit. The consistent treatment of systematic
uncertainties in the joint data set ensures that the resulting set of parton
density functions (PDFs) have a much reduced experimental uncertainty compared
to the previous PDF extractions performed separately by the H1 and ZEUS
collaborations.
