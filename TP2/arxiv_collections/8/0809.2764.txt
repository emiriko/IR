The HADES experiment, installed at GSI, Darmstadt, measures di-electron
production in A+A, p/pi+N and p/pi+A collisions. Here, the pi0 and eta Dalitz
decays have been reconstructed in the exclusive p+p reaction at 2.2 GeV to form
a reference cocktail for long-lived di-electron sources. In the C+C reaction at
1 and 2 GeV/u, these long-lived sources have been subtracted from the measured
inclusive e+e- yield to exhibit the signal from the early phase of the
collision. The results suggest that resonances play an important role in dense
nuclear matter.
