We present new experimental results of low temperature x-ray synchrotron
diffraction, neutron scattering and very low temperature (mK-range) bulk
measurements on the nanotube system ${\tube}$. The crystal structure determined
from our data is similar to the previously proposed model (P. Millet {\it et
al.} J. Solid State Chem. $\bf{147}$, 676 (1999)), but also deviates from it in
significant details. The structure comprises nanotubes along the c-axis formed
by stacking units of two V-rings buckled in the $ab$-plane. The space group is
P$\bar{3}$ and the composition is nonstoichiometric, Na(2-x)V3O7, x=0.17. The
thermal evolution of the lattice parameters reveals anisotropic lattice
compression on cooling. Neutron scattering experiments monitor a very weak
magnetic signal at energies from -20 to 9 meV. New magnetic susceptibility,
specific heat measurements and decay of remanent magnetization in the 30 mK -
300 mK range reveal that the previously observed transition at ~76 mK is
spin-glass like with no long-range order. Presented experimental observations
do not support models of isolated clusters, but are compatible with a model of
odd-legged S=1/2 spin tubes possibly segmented into fragments with different
lengths.
