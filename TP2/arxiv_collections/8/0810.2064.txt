We study the equations of a two dimensional incompressible Newtonian fluid
coupled with a dispersive parabolic-elliptic system on bounded domains. Global
in time weak solutions are shown to exist and converge with a rate to the
stationary solution for L^2 initial data. This paper extends and improves on a
body of work surrounding the Debye-Huckel system to the hydrodyanamical case.
