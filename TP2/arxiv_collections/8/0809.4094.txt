Spin polarization of the tunnel conductivity has been studied for Fe/GaAs
junctions with Schottky barriers. It is shown that band matching of resonant
interface states within the Schottky barrier defines the sign of spin
polarization of electrons transported through the barrier. The results account
very well for experimental results including the tunneling of photo-excited
electrons, and suggest that the spin polarization (from -100% to 100%) is
dependent on the Schottky barrier height. They also suggest that the sign of
the spin polarization can be controlled with a bias voltage.
