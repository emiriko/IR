The existence of a random attractor in H^1(R^3) \times L^2(R^3) is proved for
the damped semilinear stochastic wave equation defined on the entire space R^3.
The nonlinearity is allowed to have a cubic growth rate which is referred to as
the critical exponent. The uniform pullback estimates on the tails of solutions
for large space variables are established. The pullback asymptotic compactness
of the random dynamical system is proved by using these tail estimates and the
energy equation method.
