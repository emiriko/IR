We present an analysis of complete positivity (CP) constraints on qutrit
quantum channels that have a form of affine transformations of generalized
Bloch vector. For diagonal (damping) channels we derive conditions analogous to
the ones that in qubit case produce tetrahedron structure in the channel
parameter space.
