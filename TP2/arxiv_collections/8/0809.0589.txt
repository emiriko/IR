Quantum phase transitions occur at zero temperature, when the ground state of
a Hamiltonian undergoes a qualitative change as a function of a control
parameter. We consider a particularly interesting system with competing one-,
two- and three-body interactions. Depending on the relative strength of these
interactions, the ground state of the system can be a product state, or it can
exhibit genuine tripartite entanglement. We experimentally simulate such a
system in an NMR quantum simulator and observe the different ground states. By
adiabatically changing the strength of one coupling constant, we push the
system from one ground state to a qualitatively different ground state. We show
that these ground states can be distinguished and the transitions between them
observed by measuring correlations between the spins or the expectation values
of suitable entanglement witnesses.
