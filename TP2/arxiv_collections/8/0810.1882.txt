We have studied the diffusion of a single particle on a one-dimensional
lattice. It is shown that, for a self-similar distribution of hopping rates,
the time dependence of the mean-square displacement follows an anomalous power
law modulated by logarithmic periodic oscillations. The origin of this
modulation is traced to the dependence on the length of the diffusion
coefficient. Both the random walk exponent and the period of the modulation are
analytically calculated and confirmed by Monte Carlo simulations.
