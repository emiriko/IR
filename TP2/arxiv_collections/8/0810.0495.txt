We measure the flux of spherical glass beads through a hole as a systematic
function of both tilt angle and hole diameter, for two different size beads.
The discharge increases with hole diameter in accord with the Beverloo relation
for both horizontal and vertical holes, but in the latter case with a larger
small-hole cutoff. For large holes the flux decreases linearly in cosine of the
tilt angle, vanishing smoothly somewhat below the angle of repose. For small
holes it vanishes abruptly at a smaller angle. The conditions for zero flux are
discussed in the context of a {\it clogging phase diagram} of flow state vs
tilt angle and ratio of hole to grain size.
