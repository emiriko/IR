The optoelectronic fiber delay line microwave oscillator offers attractive
and large potential for numerous applications in high speed fiber optics
communication, space, and radar systems. Its relevant features are very low
phase noise and wide-range tunability, while operating at frequencies of tens
of GHz. We consider the contribution of the DFB laser to the oscillator phase
noise. Low frequency spectra of wavelength fluctuation and RIN are measured and
analyzed. As a conclusion, the oscillator phase noise can be improved by proper
choice of optic and optoelectronic components.
