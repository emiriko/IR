The paper proposes a new fragmentation mechanism of dendrite arms. The
theoretical basis of this mechanism is a shift in the thermodynamical
equilibrium at the solid-liquid interface due to the presence of elastic
energy. This effect is modelled by the generalized Gibbs-Thomson condition [1],
where each term is calculated analytically using a simple Bernoulli-Euler beam
model. The resulting nonlinear system of ordinary differential equations is
integrated in time using a fully implicit scheme. It is demonstrated that there
is a critical level of loading, exceeding which causes a catastrophic reduction
of the neck cross section leading to dendrite detachment.
