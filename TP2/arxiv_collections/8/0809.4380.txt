We show that random walks on the infinite supercritical percolation clusters
in Z^d satisfy the usual Law of the Iterated Logarithm. The proof combines
Barlow's Gaussian heat kernel estimates and the ergodicity of the random walk
on the environment viewed from the random walker as derived by Berger and
Biskup.
