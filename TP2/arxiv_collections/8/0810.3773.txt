It is demonstrated that, if one remains in the framework of quantum mechanics
taken alone, stationary states (energy eigenstates) are in no way singled out
with respect to nonstationary ones, and moreover the stationary states would be
difficult if possible to realize in practice. Owing to the nonstationary states
any quantum system can absorb or emit energy in arbitrary continuous amounts.
The peculiarity of the stationary states appears only if electromagnetic
radiation that must always accompany nonstationary processes in real systems is
taken into account. On the other hand, when the quantum system absorbs or emits
energy in the form of a wave the determining role is played by resonance
interaction of the system with the wave. Here again the stationary states
manifest themselves. These facts and influence of the resonator upon the
incident wave enable one to explain all effects ascribed to manifestation of
the corpuscular properties of light (the photoelectric effect, the Compton
effect etc.) solely on a base of the wave concept of light.
