We prove the following results for task allocation of indivisible resources:
  - The problem of finding a leximin-maximal resource allocation is in P if the
agents have max-utility functions and atomic demands.
  - Deciding whether a resource allocation is Pareto-optimal is coNP-complete
for agents with (1-)additive utility functions.
  - Deciding whether there exists a Pareto-optimal and envy-free resource
allocation is Sigma_2^p-complete for agents with (1-)additive utility
functions.
