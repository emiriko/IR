We measured the temperature and fluence dependence of the time-resolved
photoinduced optical reflectivity in a decagonal Al_{71.9}Ni_{11.1}Co_{17.0}
quasicrystal. We find no evidence for the relaxation of a hot thermalized
electron gas as observed in metals. Instead, a quick diffusion of the hot
nonthermal carries ~40 nm into the bulk is detected enhanced by the presence of
a broad ~1 eV pseudogap. From the relaxation dynamics we find an evidence for
the presence of a fine structure in the electronic density of states around ~13
meV from the Fermi energy. The structure is related to a weak bottleneck for
the carrier relaxation observed at low temperatures.
