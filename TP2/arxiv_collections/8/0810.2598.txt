Neural network algorithms have been recently applied to construct Parton
Distribution Function (PDF) parametrizations which provide an alternative to
standard global fitting procedures. We propose a technique based on an
interactive neural network algorithm using Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs). SOMs
are a class of clustering algorithms based on competitive learning among
spatially-ordered neurons. Our SOMs are trained on selections of stochastically
generated PDF samples. The selection criterion for every optimization iteration
is based on the features of the clustered PDFs. Our main goal is to provide a
fitting procedure that, at variance with the standard neural network
approaches, allows for an increased control of the systematic bias by enabling
user interaction in the various stages of the process.
