Chern insulators are periodic band insulators with the property that their
projector onto the occupied bands have non-zero Chern number. Chern insulator
with a homogeneous boundary display continuum spectrum that fills the entire
insulating gap. The local density of states corresponding to this part of the
spectrum is localized near the boundary, hence the terminology edge spectrum.
An interesting question arises, namely, if a rough boundary, which can be seen
as a strong random potential acting on these quasi 1-dimensional states, would
destroy the continuum edge spectrum. This paper shows how such question can be
answered via a newly formulated abstract framework in which the expectation
value of the current of a general observable is connected to the index of a
specific Fredholm operator. For the present application, we will connect the
expectation value of the charge edge current with the index of a Fredholm
operator that remains invariant under arbitrary deformations of the boundary.
