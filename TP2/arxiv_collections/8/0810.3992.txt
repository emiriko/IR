Although the spike-trains in neural networks are mainly constrained by the
neural dynamics itself, global temporal constraints (refractoriness, time
precision, propagation delays, ..) are also to be taken into account. These
constraints are revisited in this paper in order to use them in event-based
simulation paradigms.
  We first review these constraints, and discuss their consequences at the
simulation level, showing how event-based simulation of time-constrained
networks can be simplified in this context: the underlying data-structures are
strongly simplified, while event-based and clock-based mechanisms can be easily
mixed. These ideas are applied to punctual conductance-based generalized
integrate-and-fire neural networks simulation, while spike-response model
simulations are also revisited within this framework.
  As an outcome, a fast minimal complementary alternative with respect to
existing simulation event-based methods, with the possibility to simulate
interesting neuron models is implemented and experimented.
