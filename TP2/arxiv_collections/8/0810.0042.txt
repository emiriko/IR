We employ a simple effective model to study the chiral dynamics of two
flavors of quarks at finite temperature and density. In particular, we
determine the phase diagram in the plane of temperature and baryon chemical
potential as a function of the pion mass. An interesting phase structure occurs
which results in zero, one or two critical points depending on the value of the
vacuum pion mass.
