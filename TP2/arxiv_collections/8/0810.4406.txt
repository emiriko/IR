The nuclear level densities of 116,117Sn below the neutron separation energy
have been determined experimentally from the (3He,alpha gamma) and (3He,3He
gamma') reactions, respectively. The level densities show a characteristic
exponential increase and a difference in magnitude due to the odd-even effect
of the nuclear systems. In addition, the level densities display pronounced
step-like structures that are interpreted as signatures of subsequent breaking
of nucleon pairs.
