We propose a new approach to implement quantum repeaters for long distance
quantum communication. Our protocol generates a backbone of encoded Bell pairs
and uses the procedure of classical error correction during simultaneous
entanglement connection. We illustrate that the repeater protocol with simple
Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) encoding can significantly extend the
communication distance, while still maintaining a fast key generation rate.
