We first show that an earthquake of a geometrically infinite hyperbolic
surface induces an asymptotically conformal change in the hyperbolic metric if
and only if the measured lamination associated with the earthquake is
asymptotically trivial on the surface. Then we show that the contraction along
earthquake paths is continuous in the Teichm\"uller space of any hyperbolic
surface. Finally, we show that if a measured lamination vanishes while
approaching infinity at the rate higher than the distance to the boundary then
it must be trivial.
