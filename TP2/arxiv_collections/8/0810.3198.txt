Symmetries of geometrical and physical quantities in general relativity
provide important information about the curvature structure of the spacetimes.
Symmetries of the curvature and the Weyl tensors, known as curvature and Weyl
collineations respectively, are two of such important symmetries. Some results
on these symmetries for Bianchi type V spacetimes are discussed.
