We formulate the generalized master equation for a class of continuous time
random walks in the presence of a prescribed deterministic evolution between
successive transitions. This formulation is exemplified by means of an
advection-diffusion and a jump-diffusion scheme. Based on this master equation,
we also derive reaction-diffusion equations for subdiffusive chemical species,
using a mean field approximation.
