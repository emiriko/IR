A permutomino of size n is a polyomino determined by a pair of permutations
of size n+1, such that they differ in each position. In this paper, after
recalling some enumerative results about permutominoes, we give a first
algorithm for the exhaustive generation of a particular class of permutominoes,
the convex permutominoes, proving that its cost is proportional to the number
of generated objects.
