Fluids in porous media are commonly studied with analytical or simulation
methods, usually assuming that the host medium is rigid. By evaluating the
substrate's response (relaxation) to the presence of the fluid we assess the
error inherent in that assumption. One application is a determination of the
ground state of 3He in slit and cylindrical pores. With the relaxation, there
results a much stronger cohesion than would be found for a rigid host. Similar
increased binding effects of relaxation are found for classical fluids confined
within slit pores or nanotube bundles.
