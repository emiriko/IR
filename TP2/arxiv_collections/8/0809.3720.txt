We show that the action of Cremona transformations on the real points of
quadrics exhibits the full complexity of the diffeomorphisms of the sphere, the
torus, and of all non-orientable surfaces. The main result says that if X is
rational, then Aut(X), the group of algebraic automorphisms, is dense in
Diff(X), the group of self-diffeomorphisms of X.
