A detector using liquid Xenon (LXe) in the scintillation mode is studied for
Positron Emission Tomography (PET) of small animals. Its specific design aims
at taking full advantage of the Liquid Xenon scintillation properties. This
paper reports on energy, time and spatial resolution capabilities of the first
LXe prototype module equipped with a Position Sensitive Photo- Multiplier tube
(PSPMT) operating in the VUV range (178 nm) and at 165 K. The experimental
results show that such a LXe PET configuration might be a promising solution
insensitive to any parallax effect.
