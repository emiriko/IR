The presence of a strong magnetic background can modify the nature and the
dynamics of the chiral phase transition at finite temperature: for high enough
magnetic fields, comparable to the ones expected to be created in noncentral
high-energy heavy ion collisions at RHIC and the LHC, the original crossover is
turned into a first-order transition. We illustrate this effect within the
linear sigma model with quarks to one loop in the ${\rm MS}$ scheme for
$N_{f}=2$.
