Quantum control requires full knowledge of the system many-body Hamiltonian.
In many cases this information is not directly available due to restricted
access to the system. Here we show how to indirectly estimate all the coupling
strengths in a spin chain by measuring one spin at the end of the chain. We
also discuss the efficiency of this "quantum inverse problem" and give a
numerical example.
