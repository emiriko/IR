Comprehensive knowledge of protein-ligand interactions should provide a
useful basis for annotating protein functions, studying protein evolution,
engineering enzymatic activity, and designing drugs. To investigate the
diversity and universality of ligand binding sites in protein structures, we
conducted the all-against-all atomic-level structural comparison of over
180,000 ligand binding sites found in all the known structures in the Protein
Data Bank by using a recently developed database search and alignment
algorithm. By applying a hybrid top-down-bottom-up clustering analysis to the
comparison results, we determined approximately 3000 well-defined structural
motifs of ligand binding sites. Apart from a handful of exceptions, most
structural motifs were found to be confined within single families or
superfamilies, and to be associated with particular ligands. Furthermore, we
analyzed the components of the similarity network and enumerated more than 4000
pairs of ligand binding sites that were shared across different protein folds.
