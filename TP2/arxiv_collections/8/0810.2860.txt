In the framework of Bohmian quantum mechanics supplemented with the Chetaev
theorem on stable trajectories in dynamics in the presence of dissipative
forces we have shown the possibility of the classical (without tunneling)
universal description of radioactive decay of heavy nuclei, in which under
certain conditions so called noise-induced transition is generated or, in other
words, the stochastic channel of alpha decay, cluster radioactivity and
spontaneous fission conditioned by the Kramers diffusion mechanism. Based on
the ENSDF database we have found the parametrized solutions of the Kramers
equation of Langevin type by Alexandrov dynamic auto-regularization method
(FORTRAN program REGN-Dubna). These solutions describe with high-accuracy the
dependence of the half-life (decay probability) of heavy radioactive nuclei on
total kinetic energy of daughter decay products. The verification of inverse
problem solution in the framework of the universal Kramers description of the
alpha decay, cluster radioactivity and spontaneous fission, which was based on
the newest experimental data of alpha-decay of even-even super heavy nuclei
(Z=114, 116, 118) have shown the good coincidence of the experimental and
theoretical half-life depend upon of alpha-decay energy.
