A novel time-reversal symmetry breaking state is found theoretically in the
Josephson junction between the two-gap superconductor and the conventional
s-wave superconductor. This occurs due to the frustration between the three
order parameters analogous to the two antiferromagnetically coupled XY-spins
put under a magnetic field. This leads to the interface states with the
energies inside the superconducting gap. Possible experimental observations of
this state with broken time-reversal symmetry are discussed.
