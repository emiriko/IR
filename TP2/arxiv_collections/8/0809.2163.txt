The energetic properties of nuclear clusters inside a low-density,
finite-temperature medium are studied with a Lattice Gas Model including
isospin dependence and Coulomb forces. Important deviations are observed
respect to the Fisher approximation of an ideal gas of non-interacting
clusters, but the global energetics can still be approximately expressed in
terms of a simple modified energy-density functional. The multi-fragmentation
regime appears dominated by combinatorial effects in this model, but the
isoscaling of the largest fragment in low energy collisions appears a promising
observable for the experimental measurement of the symmetry energy.
