We give an update on our calculation of $B_K$ using HYP-smeared valence
staggered quarks. We have results for $B_K$ at tree-level on several coarse
MILC lattices ($a\approx 0.12 $fm) and one of the fine lattices ($a\approx 0.09
$fm), using 10 light valence quarks ranging down to $m_s^{\rm phys}/10$. We
have generalized staggered chiral perturbation theory to our mixed action
setup, and outline the results. We explain our present fitting strategy, and
give some preliminary results.
