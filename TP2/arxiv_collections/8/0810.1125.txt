It is demonstrated that a standard coupled-mode theory can successfully
describe weakly-nonlinear gravity water waves in Bragg resonance with a
periodic one-dimensional topography. Analytical solutions for gap solitons
provided by this theory are in a reasonable agreement with accurate numerical
simulations of exact equations of motion for ideal planar potential
free-surface flows, even for strongly nonlinear waves. In numerical
experiments, self-localized groups of nearly standing water waves can exist up
to hundreds of wave periods. Generalizations of the model to the
three-dimensional case are also derived.
