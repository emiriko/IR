We study the potential of the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC) to probe the
spin of new massive vector boson resonances predicted by Higgsless models. We
consider its production via weak boson fusion which relies only on the coupling
between the new resonances and the weak gauge bosons. We show that the LHC will
be able to unravel the spin of the particles associated with the partial
restoration of unitarity in vector boson scattering for integrated luminosities
of 150-560 fb^-1, depending on the new state mass and on the method used in the
analyses.
