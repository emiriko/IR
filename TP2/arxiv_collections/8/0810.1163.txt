We present a sequential Monte Carlo sampler algorithm for the Bayesian
analysis of generalised linear mixed models (GLMMs). These models support a
variety of interesting regression-type analyses, but performing inference is
often extremely difficult, even when using the Bayesian approach combined with
Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). The Sequential Monte Carlo sampler (SMC) is a
new and general method for producing samples from posterior distributions. In
this article we demonstrate use of the SMC method for performing inference for
GLMMs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the method on both simulated and
real data, and find that sequential Monte Carlo is a competitive alternative to
the available MCMC techniques.
