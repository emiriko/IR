A fine structure of the breakpoint region in the current-voltage
characteristics of the coupled intrinsic Josephson junctions in the layered
superconductors is found. We establish a correspondence between the features in
the current-voltage characteristics and the character of the charge
oscillations in superconducting layers in the stack and explain the origin of
the breakpoint region structure.
