We give a new proof of the classification of normal singular surface germs
admitting non-invertible holomorphic self-maps and due to J. Wahl. We then draw
an analogy between the birational classification of singular holomorphic
foliations on surfaces, and the dynamics of holomorphic maps. Following this
analogy, we introduce the notion of minimal holomorphic model for holomorphic
maps. We give sufficient conditions which ensure the uniqueness of such a
model.
