In this note we discuss prospects of analyses at the ATLAS and CMS
experiments that are related to the production of heavy flavour quarks. Trigger
strategies are summarized and a selection of studies is presented. These
include quarkonium production studies such as the differential transverse
momentum cross section measurement and polarization studies, as well as
reconstruction of excited quarkonium states. Furthermore inclusive b quark
production is discussed.
