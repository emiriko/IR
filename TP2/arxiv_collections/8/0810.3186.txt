Measurements of magnetotransport and current-voltage (I-V) characteristics up
to 9 T were used to investigate the vortex phase diagram of an under-doped
(Ba,K)Fe2As2 single crystal with Tc=26.2 K. It is found that the anisotropy
ratio of the upper critical field Hc2 decreases from 4 to 2.8 with decreasing
temperature from Tc to 24.8 K. Consistent with the vortex-glass theory, the I-V
curves measured at H=9 T can be well scaled with the vortex-glass transition
temperature of Tg=20.7 K and critical exponents z=4.1 and v=1. Analyses in
different magnetic fields produced almost identical critical exponent values,
with some variation in Tg, corroborating the existence of the vortex-glass
transition in this under-doped (Ba,K)Fe2As2 single crystal up to 9 T. A vortex
phase diagram is presented, based on the evolution of Tg and Hc2 with magnetic
field.
