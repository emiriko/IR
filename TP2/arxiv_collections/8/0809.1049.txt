We investigate numerically the time dependence of the multiple quantum
coherences and entanglement in linear chains up to nine nuclear spins of 1/2
coupled by the dipole-dipole interactions. Two models are considered: (1) a
spin chain with nearest-neighbor dipole -dipole interactions; (2) a more
realistic model with interactions between all spins. It is shown that the
entangled states appear between remote particles which do not interact directly
(model 1), while the interaction between all spins (model 2) not always results
in entanglement between remote spins.
