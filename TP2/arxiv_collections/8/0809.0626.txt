We calculate the conductances and the tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) of
double magnetic tunnel junctions, taking as a model example junctions composed
of Fe/ZnSe/Fe/ZnSe/Fe (001). The calculations are done as a function of the
gate voltage applied to the in-between Fe layer slab. We find that the
application of a gate voltage to the in-between Fe slab strongly affects the
junctions' TMR due to the tuning or untuning of conductance resonances mediated
by quantum well states. The gate voltage allows a significant enhancement of
the TMR, in a more controllable way than by changing the thickness of the
in-between Fe slab. This effect may be useful in the design of future
spintronic devices based on the TMR effect, requiring large and controllable
TMR values.
