We discuss the optimization of a green-field beta beam in terms of baseline,
boost factor, luminosity, and isotope pair used. We identify two qualitatively
different cases: theta_13 not discovered at the time a decision has to be made
(theta_13 small), and theta_13 discovered at that time (theta_13 large). For
small theta_13, it turns out that the obtainable sensitivity is essentially a
matter of the effort one is willing to spend. For large theta_13, however, one
can find clear optimization criteria, and one can use the information on
theta_13 obtained until then.
