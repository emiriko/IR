In this paper we present the description of the flavor-untagged decays
$B_{d}^{0}\to J/\psi K^{*0}$ and $B_{s}^{0}\to J/\psi \phi$ in the transversity
basis. The study of these $B$ mesons in that basis makes it possible to extract
information about flavor SU(3) (or U(3)) symmetry and to verify if the
factorization assumption is feasible for the decay $B_{d}^{0}\to J/\psi
K^{*0}$. The lifetime ratio $\tau_{s}/\tau_{d}$ is also extracted with this
description.
