Using a viscous hydrodynamic model coupled to a hadronic cascade code,
numerous features of the dynamics and equilibrium properties are explored for
their impact on femtoscopic measurements. The equation of state, viscous
parameters and initial conditions are investigated. We find that femtoscopy is
affected by numerous model features at the 10% level, and that by including
features and adjusting unknown parameters, one can explain experimental source
size measurements to better than 10%.
