The CP violation phase phi_s and charge asymmetries in B^0_s decays have been
measured by the D0 experiment in Run II of the Fermilab Tevatron Collider where
proton anti-proton collisions take place at a center of mass energy of
sqrt{s}=1.96 TeV. The measurements are based on integrated luminosities between
1.0 fb^-1 and 2.8 fb^-1. A 1.8 sigma deviation from the Standard Model is
observed in the measurement of the CP violation phase
phi_s=-0.57^{+0.24}_{-0.30} (stat) ^{+0.07}_{-0.02} (syst) rad in the decay
channel B^0_s -> J/psi phi. A combination with CDF results yields a 2.2 sigma
deviation from the Standard Model.
