We use a two-photon dressing field to create an effective vector gauge
potential for Bose-condensed Rb atoms in the F=1 hyperfine ground state. The
dressed states in this Raman field are spin and momentum superpositions, and we
adiabatically load the atoms into the lowest energy dressed state. The
effective Hamiltonian of these neutral atoms is like that of charged particles
in a uniform magnetic vector potential, whose magnitude is set by the strength
and detuning of Raman coupling. The spin and momentum decomposition of the
dressed states reveals the strength of the effective vector potential, and our
measurements agree quantitatively with a simple single-particle model. While
the uniform effective vector potential described here corresponds to zero
magnetic field, our technique can be extended to non-uniform vector potentials,
giving non-zero effective magnetic fields.
