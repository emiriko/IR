We consider two alternative dark energy models: a Lorentz invariance
preserving model with a nonminimally coupled scalar field and a Lorentz
invariance violating model with a minimally coupled scalar field. We study
accelerated expansion and dynamics of equation of state parameter in these
scenarios. While a minimally coupled scalar field has not the capability to be
a successful dark energy candidate with cosmological constant line crossing, a
nonminimally coupled scalar field in the presence of Lorentz invariance or a
minimally coupled scalar field with Lorentz invariance violation have this
capability. In the later case, accelerated expansion and phantom divide line
crossing are the results of interactive nature of this Lorentz violating
scenario.
