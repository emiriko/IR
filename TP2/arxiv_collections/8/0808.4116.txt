The method of an effective potential is used to investigate the possible
types of evolution of vacuum shells in the Friedman-Schwarzschild world. Such
shells are assumed to emerge during phase transitions in the early Universe.
The possible global geometries are constructed for the Friedman- Schwarzschild
worlds. Approximate solutions to the equation of motion of a vacuum shell have
been found. The conditions under which the end result of the evolution of the
vacuum shells under consideration is the formation of black holes and wormholes
with baby universes inside have been found. The interior of this world can be a
closed, flat, or open Friedman universe.
