Hadronization in tau -> K K pi nu_tau decays is driven by both vector and
axial-vector currents that we study, guided by the following principles: The
1/N_C expansion -worked out at leading order, considering only the contribution
of the lightest spin one resonances-, approximate chiral symmetry at low
energies and the appropriate asymptotic behaviour we demand to the associated
form factors. All these features are implemented in the resonance theory. Most
of its couplings are determined by imposing the short-distance requirements of
vector and axial-vector spectral functions within QCD. We plan to improve our
prediction of the hadronic spectra using recently available experimental data.
