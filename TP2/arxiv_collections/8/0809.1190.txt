The short parton production phase in high-energy heavy-ion collisions is
treated analytically as a nonlinear diffusion process. The initial buildup of
the rapidity density distributions of produced charged hadrons within tau_p =
0.25 fm/c occurs in three sources during the colored partonic phase. In a
two-step approach, the subsequent diffusion in pseudorapidity space during the
interaction time of tau_int = 7-10 fm/c (mean duration of the collision) is
essentially linear as expressed in the Relativistic Diffusion Model (RDM) which
yields excellent agreement with the data at RHIC energies, and allows for
predictions at LHC energies. Results for d+Au are discussed in detail.
