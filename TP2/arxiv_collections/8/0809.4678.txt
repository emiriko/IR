Two examples of spectral triples with non-integer dimension spectrum are
considered. These triples involve commutative C*-algebras. The first example
has complex dimension spectrum and trivial differential algebra. The other is a
parameter dependent deformation of the canonical spectral triple over S1. Its
dimension spectrum includes real non-integer values. It has a non-trivial
differential algebra and in contrast with the one dimensional case there are no
junk forms for a non-vanishing deformation parameter. The distance on this
space depends non-trivially on this parameter.
