In the ancient Egypt seven goddesses, represented by seven cows, composed the
celestial herd that provides the nourishment to her worshippers. This herd is
observed in the sky as a group of stars, the Pleiades, close to Aldebaran, the
main star in the Taurus constellation. For many ancient populations, Pleiades
were relevant stars and their rising was marked as a special time of the year.
In this paper, we will discuss the presence of these stars in ancient cultures.
Moreover, we will report some results of archeoastronomy on the role for
timekeeping of these stars, results which show that for hunter-gatherers at
Palaeolithic times, they were linked to the seasonal cycles of aurochs.
