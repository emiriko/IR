We generalize the recently developed diagrammatic Monte Carlo techniques for
quantum impurity models from an imaginary time to a Keldysh formalism suitable
for real-time and nonequilibrium calculations. Both weak-coupling and
strong-coupling based methods are introduced, analysed and applied to the study
of transport and relaxation dynamics in interacting quantum dots.
