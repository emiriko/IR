In this paper we study crumpled surfaces through Monte Carlo Simulations. The
crumpled surface is represented by a cluster of spins pointing up and spins
pointing down represent the air both inside and around the surface. We follow
the time dynamics of this fractal structure and we have shown that it presents
a stretched exponential behaviour.
