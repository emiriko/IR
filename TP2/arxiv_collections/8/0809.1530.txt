We have studied the wave properties of the cold and isothermal plasma in the
vicinity of the Schwarzschild black hole event horizon. The Fourier analyzed
perturbed 3+1 GRMHD equations are taken on the basis of which the complex
dispersion relations are obtained for non-rotating, rotating non-magnetized and
rotating magnetized backgrounds. The propagation and attenuation vectors along
with the refractive index are obtained (shown in graphs) to study the
dispersive properties of the medium near the event horizon. The results show
that no information can be obtained from the Schwarzschild magnetosphere.
Further, the pressure ceases the existence of normal dispersion of waves.
