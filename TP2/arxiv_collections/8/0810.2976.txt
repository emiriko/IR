The logarithmic relation between interfacial separation and squeezing
pressure between randomly rough surfaces, has been predicted by both theory and
experiment. However, the experimental slope between interfacial separation and
logarithmic squeezing pressure, is slightly bigger than that predicted by
theory. Here we present a detailed explanation on the slope difference between
theory and experiment.
