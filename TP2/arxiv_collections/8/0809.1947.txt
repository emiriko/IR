We study finite size effects for the gap of the quasiparticle excitation
spectrum in the weakly interacting regime one-dimensional Hubbard model with
on-site attraction. Two type of corrections to the result of the thermodynamic
limit are obtained. Aside from a power law (conformal) correction due to
gapless excitations which behaves as $1/N_a$, where $N_a$ is the number of
lattice sites, we obtain corrections related to the existence of gapped
excitations. First of all, there is an exponential correction which in the
weakly interacting regime ($|U|\ll t$) behaves as $\sim \exp (-N_a
\Delta_{\infty}/4 t)$ in the extreme limit of $N_a \Delta_{\infty} /t \gg 1$,
where $t$ is the hopping amplitude, $U$ is the on-site energy, and
$\Delta_{\infty}$ is the gap in the thermodynamic limit. Second, in a finite
size system a spin-flip producing unpaired fermions leads to the appearance of
solitons with non-zero momenta, which provides an extra (non-exponential)
contribution $\delta$. For moderate but still large values of
$N_a\Delta_{\infty} /t$, these corrections significantly increase and may
become comparable with the $1/N_a$ conformal correction. Moreover, in the case
of weak interactions where $\Delta_{\infty}\ll t$, the exponential correction
exceeds higher order power law corrections in a wide range of parameters,
namely for $N_a\lesssim (8t/\Delta_{\infty})\ln(4t/|U|)$, and so does $\delta$
even in a wider range of $N_a$. For sufficiently small number of particles,
which can be of the order of thousands in the weakly interacting regime, the
gap is fully dominated by finite size effects.
