We review recent progress in numerical simulations with dually transformed
SU(2) LGT, starting with a discussion of explicit dual amplitudes and
algorithms for SU(2) pure Yang Mills in D=3 and D=4. In the D=3 case, we
discuss results that validate the dual algorithm against conventional
simulations. We also review how a local, exact dynamical fermion algorithm can
naturally be incorporated into the dual framework. We conclude with an outlook
for this technique and a look at some of the current challenges we've
encountered with this method, specifically critical slowing down and the sign
problem.
