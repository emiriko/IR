The SNO+ experiment is the follow-up to the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory
(SNO). The heavy water that was in SNO will be replaced with a liquid
scintillator of linear alkylbenzene (plus fluor). SNO+ has many physics goals
including detecting pep and CNO solar neutrinos, detecting geo-neutrinos,
studying reactor neutrino oscillations, serving as a supernova neutrino
detector and carrying out a search for neutrinoless double beta decay by adding
neodymium to the liquid scintillator. Since a large amount of 150Nd isotope can
be added to SNO+, a competitive search would be possible, with sensitivity
below 100 meV using natural Nd and sensitivity below 40 meV with enriched
neodymium.
