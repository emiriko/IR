Event horizons are the defining physical features of black hole spacetimes,
and are of considerable interest in studying black hole dynamics. Here, we
reconsider three techniques to localise event horizons in numerical spacetimes:
integrating geodesics, integrating a surface, and integrating a level-set of
surfaces over a volume. We implement the first two techniques and find that
straightforward integration of geodesics backward in time to be most robust. We
find that the exponential rate of approach of a null surface towards the event
horizon of a spinning black hole equals the surface gravity of the black hole.
In head-on mergers we are able to track quasi-normal ringing of the merged
black hole through seven oscillations, covering a dynamic range of about 10^5.
Both at late times (when the final black hole has settled down) and at early
times (before the merger), the apparent horizon is found to be an excellent
approximation of the event horizon. In the head-on binary black hole merger,
only {\em some} of the future null generators of the horizon are found to start
from past null infinity; the others approach the event horizons of the
individual black holes at times far before merger.
