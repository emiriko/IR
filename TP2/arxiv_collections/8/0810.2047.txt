We explore the electronic interactions between a thin gold film and a surface
layer of the molecular magnet Mn_12-acetate. Magnetoresistance measurements of
the gold allow characterization of the interactions by comparison with the
theoretical predictions of weak localization. We find that the presence of
Mn_12-acetate on the surface of the gold film leads to a reduction in elastic
scattering while increasing the spin scattering of the conduction electrons.
This is the first experimental evidence of molecular magnets being used as
scattering centers for an adjacent metallic film.
