The structure of a single alanine-based Ace-AEAAAKEAAAKA-Nme peptide in
explicit aqueous electrolyte solutions (NaCl, KCl, NaI, and KF) at large salt
concentrations (3-4 M) is investigated using 1 microsecond molecular dynamics
(MD) computer simulations. The peptide displays 71 alpha-helical structure
without salt and destabilizes with the addition of NaCl in agreement with
experiments of a somewhat longer version. It is mainly stabilized by direct and
indirect (i+4)EK salt bridges between the Lys and Glu side chains and a
concomitant backbone shielding mechanism. NaI is found to be a stronger
denaturant than NaCl, while the potassium salts hardly show influence.
Investigation of the molecular structures reveals that consistent with recent
experiments Na+ has a much stronger affinity to side chain carboxylates and
backbone carbonyls than K+, thereby weakening salt bridges and secondary
structure hydrogen bonds. At the same time the large I- has a considerable
affinity to the nonpolar alanine in line with recent observations of a large
propensity of I- to adsorb to simple hydrophobes, and thereby 'assists' Na+ in
its destabilizing action. In the denatured states of the peptide novel
long-lived (10-20 ns) 'loop'-configurations are observed in which single Na+
ions and water molecules are hydrogen-bonded to multiple backbone carbonyls. In
an attempt to analyze the denaturation behavior within the preferential
interaction formalism, we find indeed that for the strongest denaturant, NaI,
the protein is least hydrated. Additionally, a possible indication for protein
denaturation might be a preferential solvation of the first solvation shell of
the peptide backbone by the destabilizing cosolute (sodium).
