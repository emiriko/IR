Our purpose is to study a particular class of optimal stopping problems for
Markov processes. We justify the value function convexity and we deduce that
there exists a boundary function such that the smallest optimal stopping time
is the first time when the Markov process passes over the boundary depending on
time. Moreover, we propose a method to find the optimal boundary function.
