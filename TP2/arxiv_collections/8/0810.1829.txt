In this article, we express solutions of the Gauss hypergeometric equation as
a series of the multiple polylogarithms by using iterated integral. This
representation is the most simple case of a semisimple representation of
solutions of the formal KZ equation. Moreover, combining this representation
with the connection relations of solutions of the Gauss hypergeometric
equation, we obtain various relations of the multiple polylogarithms of one
variable and the multiple zeta values.
