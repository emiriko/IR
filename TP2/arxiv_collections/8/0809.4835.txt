We study non-standard interactions (NSIs) at reactor neutrino experiments,
and in particular, the mimicking effects on \theta_13. We present generic
formulas for oscillation probabilities including NSIs from sources and
detectors. Instructive mappings between the fundamental leptonic mixing
parameters and the effective leptonic mixing parameters are established. In
addition, NSI corrections to the mixing angles \theta_13 and \theta_12 are
discussed in detailed. Finally, we show that, even for a vanishing \theta_13,
an oscillation phenomenon may still be observed in future short baseline
reactor neutrino experiments, such as Double Chooz and Daya Bay, due to the
existences of NSIs.
