We consider a classical source, moving on the 4-D boundary of a 5-D ADS
space, that is coupled to quantum fields residing in the bulk.
Bremsstrahlung-like radiation of the corresponding quanta is shown to occur and
the S-matrix is derived assuming that the source is sufficiently massive so
that recoil effects are negligible. As an illustrative example, using the ADS
hard-wall model, we consider vector mesons coupled to a heavy nucleus that is
moved around at high speed in an accelerator ring. The meson radiation rate is
found to be finite but small. Much higher accelerations, such as when a pair of
heavy ions suffer an ultra peripheral collision, cause substantial emission of
various excited vector mesons. Predictions are made for the spectrum of this
radiation. A comparison is made against existing photon-pomeron fusion
calculations for the transverse momentum spectra of rho mesons. These have the
same overall shape as the recently measured transverse momentum distributions
at RHIC.
