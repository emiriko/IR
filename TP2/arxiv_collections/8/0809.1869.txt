This physics book provides detailed discussions on important topics in
$\tau$-charm physics that will be explored during the next few years at \bes3 .
Both theoretical and experimental issues are covered, including extensive
reviews of recent theoretical developments and experimental techniques. Among
the subjects covered are: innovations in Partial Wave Analysis (PWA),
theoretical and experimental techniques for Dalitz-plot analyses, analysis
tools to extract absolute branching fractions and measurements of decay
constants, form factors, and CP-violation and \DzDzb-oscillation parameters.
Programs of QCD studies and near-threshold tau-lepton physics measurements are
also discussed.
