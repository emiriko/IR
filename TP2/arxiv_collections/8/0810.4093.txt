We study by means of time-dependent numerical simulations the behavior of the
entanglement stemming from the Coulomb scattering between two charged particles
subject to a pulse of sinusoidal potential. We show that the splitting of the
spatial wavefunction brought about by the interaction with the potential pulse
plays a key role in the appearance of quantum correlation, thus leading under
specific conditions to a peculiar behavior. The dependence of the final
entanglement upon the physical parameters describing the pulse is discussed.
Our results can be applied to a number of physical systems, such as
electron-electron scattering in semiconductors or cold-ions dynamics in
external fields.
