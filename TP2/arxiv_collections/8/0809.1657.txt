The objective of this work is to study the magnetic properties of arrays of
Ni-Fe nanowires electrodeposited in different template materials such as porous
silicon, polycarbonate and alumina. Magnetic properties were studied as a
function of template material, applied magnetic field (parallel and
perpendicular) during deposition, wire length, as well as magnetic field
orientation during measurement. The results show that application of magnetic
field during deposition strongly influences the c-axis preferred orientation
growth of Ni-Fe nanowires. The samples with magnetic field perpendicular to
template plane during deposition exhibits strong perpendicular anisotropy with
greatly enhanced coercivity and squareness ratio, particularly in Ni-Fe
nanowires deposited in polycarbonate templates. In case of polycarbonate
template, as magnetic field during deposition increases, both coercivity and
squareness ratio also increase. The wire length dependence was also measured
for polycarbonate templates. As wire length increases, coercivity and
squareness ratio decrease, but saturation field increases. Such magnetic
behavior (dependence on template material, magnetic field, wire length) can be
qualitatively explained by preferential growth phenomena, dipolar interactio
