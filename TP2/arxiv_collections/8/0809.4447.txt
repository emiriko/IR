Using the Fitzpatrick function, we characterize the solutions for different
classes of deterministic and stochastic differential equations driven by
maximal monotone operators (or in particular subdifferential operators) as the
minimum point of a suitably chosen convex lower semicontinuous function. Such
technique provides a new approach for the existence of the solutions for the
considered equations.
