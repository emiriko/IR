We introduce a new definition for the species of type B, or H-species, analog
to the classical species (of type A), but on which we consider the action of
the groups Bn of signed permutations. We are interested in algebraic structure
on these H-species and give examples of Hopf monoids. The natural way to get a
graded vector space from a species, given in this paper in terms of functors,
will allow us to deepen our understanding of these species. In particular, the
image of the classical species of set compositions under a given functor is
isomorphic to the combinatorial Hopf algebra DQSym.
