A prospective for the inclusive search of the Standard Model Higgs boson in
the decay channel H->gammagamm is presented with the CMS experiment at the LHC.
The analysis relies on a strategy to determine the background characteristics
and systematics from data. The strategy is applied to a Monte Model of the QCD
background, with full simulation of the detector response. The discrimination
between signal and background exploits information on photon isolation and
kinematics. The resolution for the reconstructed Higgs boson mass profits from
the excellent energy resolution of the CMS crystal calorimeter. A discovery
significance above 5 sigma is expected at integrated LHC luminosities below 30
inverse femtobarn for Higgs boson masses below 140 GeV/c^2.
