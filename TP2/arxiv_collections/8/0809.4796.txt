Muon ionization cooling provides the only practical solution to prepare
high-brilliance beams necessary for a neutrino factory or muon collider. The
Muon Ionization Cooling Experiment (MICE), under development at the Rutherford
Appleton Laboratory, is installing the first set of particle detectors ever
built to measure to 0.1% the emittance of a 200 MeV/c or so muon beam in and
out of a cooling cell, and thus measure the cooling cell's performance. Two
identical "emittometers" (a precise scintillating-fiber tracker in solenoidal
magnetic field and a 50 ps time-of-flight station) measure the six phase-space
coordinates of each muon. Another TOF plane and two Cherenkov counters assure
the purity of the incoming muon beam. A downstream electron/muon calorimeter
eliminates contamination from decay electrons.
