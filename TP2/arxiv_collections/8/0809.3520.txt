We study the Mott metal-insulator transition in the Periodic Anderson Model
within Dynamical Mean Field Theory (DMFT). Near the quantum transition, we find
a non-Fermi liquid metallic state down to a vanishing temperature scale. We
identify the origin of the non-Fermi liquid behavior as due to magnetic
scattering of the doped carriers by the localized moments. The non-Fermi liquid
state can be tuned by either doping or external magnetic field. Our results
show that the coupling to spatial magnetic fluctuations (absent in DMFT) is not
a prerequisite to realize a non-Fermi liquid scenario for heavy fermion
systems.
