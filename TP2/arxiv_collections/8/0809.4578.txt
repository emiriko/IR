We study the conductance of disordered graphene superlattices with
short-range structural correlations. The system consists of electron- and
hole-doped graphenes of various thicknesses, which fluctuate randomly around
their mean value. The effect of the randomness on the probability of
transmission through the system of various sizes is studied. We show that in a
disordered superlattice the quasiparticle that approaches the barrier interface
almost perpendicularly transmits through the system. The conductivity of the
finite-size system is computed and shown that the conductance vanishes when the
sample size becomes very large, whereas for some specific structures the
conductance tends to a nonzero value in the thermodynamics limit.
