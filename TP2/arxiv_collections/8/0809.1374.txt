After briefly reviewing the problems associated with non-Abelian monopoles,
we turn our attention to the development in our understanding of non-Abelian
{\it vortices} in the last several years. In the U(N) model with $N_{f}=N$
flavors in which they were first found, the fluctuations of the orientational
modes along the vortex length and in time become strongly coupled at long
distances. They effectively reduce to Abelian ANO vortices. We discuss then a
very recent work on non-Abelian vortices with $CP^{n-1}\times CP^{r-1}$
orientational moduli, which, unlike the ones so far extensively studied, do not
dynamically Abelianize completely. The surviving vortex orientational moduli,
fluctuating along the vortex length and in time, gets absorbed by the monopoles
at the ends, turning into the dual gauge degrees of freedom for the latter.
