We present an analysis of the normal state magnetotransport in the heavy
fermion superconductor CeIrIn${_5}$. The Hall effect and the transverse
magnetoresistance in this material do not appear to be uniquely correlated, as
inferred from the field dependence of the current ratio ($R_{\sigma} =
\sigma_{xy} / \sigma_{xx}^2 H$). The Hall coefficient is seen to satisfy a
scaling equation of the form $R_H = f [H / (a + b T^c)]$. These results are
compared to those observed earlier in CeCoIn$_5$, and are discussed in terms of
the contrasting phase diagram which the CeIrIn$_5$ system exhibits in relation
to its Co counterpart.
