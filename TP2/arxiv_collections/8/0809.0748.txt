Leading towards the classification of primitive commutative association
schemes as the ultimate goal, Bannai and some of his school have been trying to
  * identify the major sources of (primitive) commutative association schemes,
  * collect known group-case primitive commutative association schemes, and
  * compute their character tables over the last twenty years. The construction
of their character tables are important first step for a systematic study of
such association schemes and towards the classification of those schemes. In
this talk, we briefly survey the progress made in this direction of research,
and list some open problems.
