Principal component analysis (PCA) requires the computation of a low-rank
approximation to a matrix containing the data being analyzed. In many
applications of PCA, the best possible accuracy of any rank-deficient
approximation is at most a few digits (measured in the spectral norm, relative
to the spectral norm of the matrix being approximated). In such circumstances,
efficient algorithms have not come with guarantees of good accuracy, unless one
or both dimensions of the matrix being approximated are small. We describe an
efficient algorithm for the low-rank approximation of matrices that produces
accuracy very close to the best possible, for matrices of arbitrary sizes. We
illustrate our theoretical results via several numerical examples.
