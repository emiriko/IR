Let X be a homogeneous polynomial vector field of degree 2 on S^2. We show
that if X has at least a non--hyperbolic singularity, then it has no limit
cycles. We give necessary and sufficient conditions for determining if a
singularity of X on S^2 is a center and we characterize the global phase
portrait of X modulo limit cycles. We also study the Hopf bifurcation of X and
we reduce the 16^{th} Hilbert's problem restricted to this class of polynomial
vector fields to the study of two particular families. Moreover, we present two
criteria for studying the nonexistence of periodic orbits for homogeneous
polynomial vector fields on S^2 of degree n.
