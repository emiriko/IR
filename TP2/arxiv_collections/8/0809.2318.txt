Considering the Cauchy problem for the modified finite-depth-fluid equation
$\partial_tu-\G_\delta(\partial_x^2u)\mp u^2u_x=0, u(0)=u_0$, where $\G_\delta
f=-i \ft ^{-1}[\coth(2\pi \delta \xi)-\frac{1}{2\pi \delta \xi}]\ft f$,
$\delta\ges 1$, and $u$ is a real-valued function, we show that it is uniformly
globally well-posed if $u_0 \in H^s (s\geq 1/2)$ with $\norm{u_0}_{L^2}$
sufficiently small for all $\delta \ges 1$. Our result is sharp in the sense
that the solution map fails to be $C^3$ in $H^s (s<1/2)$. Moreover, we prove
that for any $T>0$, its solution converges in $C([0,T]; H^s)$ to that of the
modified Benjamin-Ono equation if $\delta$ tends to $+\infty$.
