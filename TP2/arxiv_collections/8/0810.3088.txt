We construct quantum field theory in an analogue curved spacetime in
Bose-Einstein condensates based on the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations, by
exactly relating quantum particles in curved spacetime with Bogoliubov
quasiparticle excitations in Bose-Einstein condensates. Here, we derive a
simple formula relating the two, which can be used to calculate the particle
creation spectrum by solving the time-dependent Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations.
Using our formulation, we numerically investigate particle creation in an
analogue expanding Universe which can be expressed as Bogoliubov quasiparticles
in an expanding Bose-Einstein condensate. We obtain its spectrum, which follows
the thermal Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, the temperature of which is
experimentally attainable. Our derivation of the analogy is useful for general
Bose-Einstein condensates and not limited to homogeneous ones, and our
simulation is the first example of particle creations by solving the
Bogoliubov-de Gennes equation in an inhomogeneous condensate.
