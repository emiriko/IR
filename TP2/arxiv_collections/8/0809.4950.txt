We present one- and two-loop results for the ghost propagator in Landau gauge
calculated in Numerical Stochastic Perturbation Theory (NSPT). The one-loop
results are compared with available standard Lattice Perturbation Theory in the
infinite-volume limit. We discuss in detail how to perform the different
necessary limits in the NSPT approach and discuss a recipe to treat logarithmic
terms by introducing ``finite-lattice logs''. We find agreement with the
one-loop result from standard Lattice Perturbation Theory and estimate, from
the non-logarithmic part of the ghost propagator in two-loop order, the unknown
constant contribution to the ghost self-energy in the RI'-MOM scheme in Landau
gauge. That constant vanishes within our numerical accuracy.
