The improved light-cone QCD sum rules by using chiral current correlator is
systematically reviewed and applied to the calculation of all the
heavy-to-light form factors, including all the semileptonic and penguin ones.
By choosing suitable chiral currents, the light-cone sum rules for all the form
factors are greatly simplified and depend mainly on one leading twist
distribution amplitude of the light meson. As a result, relations between these
form factors arise naturally. At the considered accuracy these relations
reproduce the results obtained in the literature. Moreover, since the explicit
dependence on the leading twist distribution amplitudes is preserved, these
relations may be more useful to simulate the experimental data and extract the
information on the distribution amplitude.
