This paper investigates the impact of carrier frequency offset (CFO) on the
performance of different MIMO-OFDM schemes with high spectral efficiency for
next generation of terrestrial digital TV. We show that all studied MIMO-OFDM
schemes are sensitive to CFO when it is greater than 1% of inter-carrier
spacing. We show also that the Alamouti scheme is the most sensitive MIMO
scheme to CFO
