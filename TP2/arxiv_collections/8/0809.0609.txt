We indicate that the random aperiodic oscillation of the gluon distributions
in a modified Balisky--Fadin--Kuraev--Lipatov (BFKL) equation has positive
Lyapunov exponents. This first example of chaos in QCD evolution equations,
raises the sudden disappearance of the gluon distributions at a critical small
value of the Bjorken variable $x$ and may stop the increase of the new particle
events in an ultra high energy hadron collider.
