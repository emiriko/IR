In this work we present a general mechanism by which simple dynamics running
on networks become self-organized critical for scale free topologies. We
illustrate this mechanism with a simple arithmetic model of division between
integers, the division model. This is the simplest self-organized critical
model advanced so far, and in this sense it may help to elucidate the mechanism
of self-organization to criticality. Its simplicity allows analytical
tractability, characterizing several scaling relations. Furthermore, its
mathematical nature brings about interesting connections between statistical
physics and number theoretical concepts. We show how this model can be
understood as a self-organized stochastic process embedded on a network, where
the onset of criticality is induced by the topology.
