A search for the production of neutral Higgs bosons decaying into tau
anti-tau final states is presented in p-pbar collisions at a center-of-mass
energy of 1.96 TeV. The integrated luminosity used for the study is about 2.2
fb^-1, collected by the DO Experiment at the Fermilab Tevatron Collider. No
significant excess is observed over the background expectation. The results are
interpreted in the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) and regions in
the mA, tan(beta) parameter space for two MSSM benchmark scenarios are
excluded.
