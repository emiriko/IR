We study the global and local existence and uniqueness of solutions to the
Navier-Stokes equations with anisotropic viscosity in a bounded cylindrical
domain $Q=\Omega\times (0,1)$, where $\Omega$ is a star-shaped domain in $R^2$.
In this paper, we consider the case of homogeneous Dirichlet boundary
conditions on the lateral boundary and vanishing normal trace on the top and
the bottom.
