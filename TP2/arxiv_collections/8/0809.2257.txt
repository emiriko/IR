These notes are an introduction to a few selected theoretical ideas in the
field of quantum spin liquids: classical zero modes and breakdown of the 1/S
expansion, the Lieb-Schultz-Mattis-Hastings theorem and Oshikawa's argument,
the short-ranged resonating valence-bond picture, large-N limit (Schwinger
bosons) and Z_2 gauge theory.
