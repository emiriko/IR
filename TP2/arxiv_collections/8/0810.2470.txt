A device for UHV cleavage of crystal specimens for the use with STM has been
suggested and developed. We present a device suitable for the precise cleavage
of semiconductors. The device needs only small space and can be easily mounted
in a small and compact UHV chamber equipped with a wobble stick manipulator. In
order to prove the technique UHV STM measurements on InAs(110) surfaces with
different bulk conductivities (p-and n-type) have been performed.
