A commonplace view of pressure-driven turbulence in pipes and channels is as
"cascades" of streamwise momentum toward the viscous layer at the wall. We
present in this paper an alternative picture of these flows as "inverse
cascades" of spanwise vorticity, in the cross-stream direction but away from
the viscous sublayer. We show that there is a constant spatial flux of spanwise
vorticity, due to vorticity conservation, and that this flux is necessary to
produce pressure-drop and energy dissipation. The vorticity transport is shown
to be dominated by viscous diffusion at distances closer to the wall than the
peak Reynolds stress, well into the classical log-layer. The Perry-Chong model
based on "representative" hairpin/horsehoe vortices predicts a single sign of
the turbulent vorticity flux over the whole log-layer, whereas the actual flux
must change sign at the location of the Reynolds-stress maximum. Sign-reversal
may be achieved by assuming a slow power-law decay of the Townsend "eddy
intensity function" for wall-normal distances greater than the hairpin
length-scale. The vortex-cascade picture presented here has a close analogue in
the theory of quantum superfluids and superconductors, the "phase slippage" of
quantized vortex lines. Most of our results should therefore apply as well to
superfluid turbulence in pipes and channels. We also discuss issues about
drag-reduction from this perspective.
