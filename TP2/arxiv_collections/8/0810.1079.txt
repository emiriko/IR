In this contribution, I summarise the studies of the properties of
Bose-Einstein condensed systems composed of up to twelve pions or kaons carried
out by the NPLQCD collaboration. These investigations have provided precise
determination the I=2 pi-pi and I=1 K-K scattering lengths and the first
determination of three-hadron interactions from QCD, finding a repulsive
three-pion interaction of size consistent with naive dimensional analysis and a
three kaon interaction consistent with zero. We have also determined the
isospin (strangeness) density dependence of the isospin (strangeness) chemical
potential, finding results in surprisingly good agreement with chiral
perturbation theory.
