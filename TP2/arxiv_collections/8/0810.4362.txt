In this work several aspects of ATLAS RPC offline monitoring and data quality
assessment are illustrated with cosmics data selected by RPC trigger. These
correspond to trigger selection, front-end mapping, detection efficiency and
occupancy, which are studied in terms of low level quantities such as: RPC
off-line hits and standalone tracks. The tools and techniques presented are
also extended to the forthcoming LHC p-p beam collisions.
