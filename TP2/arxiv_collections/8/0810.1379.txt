We analyse a recently constructed class of local solutions of type IIB
supergravity that consist of a warped product of AdS_3 with a seven-dimensional
internal space. In one duality frame the only other non-vanishing fields are
the NS three-form and the dilaton. We analyse in detail how these local
solutions can be extended to globally well-defined solutions of type IIB string
theory, with the internal space having topology S^3 x S^3 x S^1 and with
properly quantised three-form flux.
