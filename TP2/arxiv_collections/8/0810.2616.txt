The space subdivision in cells resulting from a process of random nucleation
and growth is a subject of interest in many scientific fields. In this paper,
we deduce the expected value and variance of these distributions while assuming
that the space subdivision process is in accordance with the premises of the
Kolmogorov-Johnson-Mehl-Avrami model. We have not imposed restrictions on the
time dependency of nucleation and growth rates. We have also developed an
approximate analytical cell size probability density function. Finally, we have
applied our approach to the distributions resulting from solid phase
crystallization under isochronal heating conditions.
