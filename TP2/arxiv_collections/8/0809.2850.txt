This paper shows how to analyze plasmonic metal-insulator-metal waveguides
using the full modal structure of these guides. The analysis applies to all
frequencies, particularly including the near infrared and visible spectrum, and
to a wide range of sizes, including nanometallic structures. We use the
approach here specifically to analyze waveguide junctions. We show that the
full modal structure of the metal-insulator-metal (MIM) waveguides--which
consists of real and complex discrete eigenvalue spectra, as well as the
continuous spectrum--forms a complete basis set. We provide the derivation of
these modes using the techniques developed for Sturm-Liouville and generalized
eigenvalue equations. We demonstrate the need to include all parts of the
spectrum to have a complete set of basis vectors to describe scattering within
MIM waveguides with the mode-matching technique. We numerically compare the
mode-matching formulation with finite-difference frequency-domain analysis and
find very good agreement between the two for modal scattering at symmetric MIM
waveguide junctions. We touch upon the similarities between the underlying
mathematical structure of the MIM waveguide and the PT symmetric quantum
mechanical pseudo-Hermitian Hamiltonians. The rich set of modes that the MIM
waveguide supports forms a canonical example against which other more
complicated geometries can be compared. Our work here encompasses the microwave
results, but extends also to waveguides with real metals even at infrared and
optical frequencies.
