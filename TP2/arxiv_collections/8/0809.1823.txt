By using the novel property of the rectangular superscatterer, we propose a
design which can conceal an entrance from electromagnetic wave detection. Such
a superscatterer is realized by coating a negative index material shell on a
perfect electrical conductor rectangle cylinder. The results are numerically
confirmed by full-wave simulations both in the far-field and near-field.
