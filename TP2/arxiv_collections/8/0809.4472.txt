We search for charged massive long-lived particles using 1.1 fb$^{-1}$ of
data collected by the D0 detector at the Fermilab Tevatron $p\bar{p}$ Collider.
Time-of-flight information is used to search for pair produced long-lived tau
sleptons, gaugino-like charginos, and higgsino-like charginos. We find no
evidence of a signal and set 95% C.L. cross section upper limits for staus,
which vary from 0.31pb to 0.04pb for stau masses between 60 GeV and 300 GeV. We
also set lower mass limits of 206 GeV (171 GeV) for pair produced charged
gauginos (higgsinos).
