This present paper has the purpose to find certain physical appications of
Lobachevsky geometry and of the algebraic geometry approach in theories with
extra dimensions. It has been shown how the periodic properties of the
uniformization functions-solutions of cubic algebraic equations in gravity
theory enable the orbifold periodic identification of the points pr{c} and
-pr{c} under compactification. It has been speculated that corrections to the
extradimensional volume in theories with extra dimensions should be taken into
account due to the non-euclidean nature of the Lobachevsky space. It has been
demonstrated that in the Higgs mass generation model with two branes (a
"hidden" and a "visible" one), to any mass on the visible brane there could
correspond a number of physical masses. Algebraic equations for 4D
Schwarzschild Black Holes in higher dimensional brane worlds have been
obtained.
