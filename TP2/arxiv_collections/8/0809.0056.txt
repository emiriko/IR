We investigate the binding nature of the endohedral sodium atoms with the
ensity functional theory methods, presuming that the clathrate I consists of a
sheaf of one-dimensional connections of Na@Si$_{24}$ cages interleaved in three
perpendicular directions. Each sodium atom loses 30% of the 3s$^1$ charge to
the frame, forming an ionic bond with the cage atoms; the rest of the electron
contributes to the covalent bond between the nearest Na atoms. The presumption
is proved to be valid; the configuration of the two Na atoms in the nearest
Si$_{24}$ cages is more stable by 0.189 eV than that in the Si$_{20}$ and
Si$_{24}$ cages. The energy of the beads of the two distorted Na atoms is more
stable by 0.104 eV than that of the two infinitely separated Na atoms. The
covalent bond explains both the preferential occupancies in the Si$_{24}$ cages
and the low anisotropic displacement parameters of the endohedral atoms in the
Si$_{24}$ cages in the [100] directions of the clathrate I.
