Thermodynamics of a spin-1 Bose gas with ferromagnetic interactions are
investigated via the mean-field theory. It is apparently shown in the specific
heat curve that the system undergoes two phase transitions, the ferromagnetic
transition and the Bose-Einstein condensation, with the Curie point above the
condensation temperature. Above the Curie point, the susceptibility fits the
Curie-Weiss law perfectly. At a fixed temperature, the reciprocal
susceptibility is also in a good linear relationship with the ferromagnetic
interaction.
