We present results for chiral extrapolations of the mass and decay constants
of the rho meson. The data sets used are the nf=2 unquenched gauge
configurations generated with twisted mass fermions by the European Twisted
Mass Collaboration. We describe a calculation of three decay constants in
charmonium and explain why they are required.
