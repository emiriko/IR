We study the strangeness contribution to nucleon matrix elements using Nf=2+1
dynamical clover fermion configurations generated by the CP-PACS/JLQCD
collaboration. In order to evaluate the disconnected insertion (DI), we use the
Z(4) stochastic method, along with unbiased subtraction from the hopping
parameter expansion which reduces the off-diagonal noises in the stochastic
method. Furthermore, we find that using many nucleon sources for each
configuration is effective in improving the signal. Our results for the quark
contribution to the first moment <x>_q in the DI, and the strangeness magnetic
moment show that the statistical errors are under control with these
techniques. We also study the gluonic contribution to the nucleon using the
overlap operator to construct the gauge field tensor, F_{mu,nu}. The
application to the calculation of first moment, <x>_G, gives a good signal in
quenched lattice QCD.
