In general relativity space-time ends at singularities. The big bang is
considered as the Beginning and the big crunch, the End. However these
conclusions are arrived at by using general relativity in regimes which lie
well beyond its physical domain of validity. Examples where detailed analysis
is possible show that these singularities are naturally resolved by quantum
geometry effects. Quantum space-times can be vastly larger than what Einstein
had us believe. These non-trivial space-time extensions enable us to answer of
some long standing questions and resolve of some puzzles in fundamental
physics. Thus, a century after Minkowski's revolutionary ideas on the nature of
space and time, yet another paradigm shift appears to await us in the wings.
