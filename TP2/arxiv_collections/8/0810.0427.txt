In 1980, G. Kreweras gave a recursive bijection between forests and parking
functions. In this paper we construct a nonrecursive bijection from forests
onto parking functions, which answers a question raised by R. Stanley. As a
by-product, we obtain a bijective proof of Gessel and Seo's formula for lucky
statistic on parking functions.
