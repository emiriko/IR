We present preliminary results of the non-perturbative heavy quark mass
dependence of heavy-light meson observables in the continuum limit of
finite-volume two-flavour lattice QCD. These observables, which are derived
from heavy-light Schroedinger functional correlation functions and computed
over a range of renormalization group invariant heavy quark masses from the
charm to beyond the bottom region, allow for a quantitative comparison with the
predictions of HQET and are of practical relevance for solving renormalization
problems in HQET non-perturbatively by a matching to QCD in finite volume.
