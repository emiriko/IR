We prove that Mathieu's N=2 supersymmetric Korteweg-de Vries equations with
a=1 or a=4 admit Hirota's n-supersoliton solutions, whose nonlinear interaction
does not produce any phase shifts. For initial profiles that can not be
distinguished from a one-soliton solution at times t<<0, we reveal the
possibility of a spontaneous decay and, within a finite time, transformation
into a solitonic solution with a different wave number. This paradoxal effect
is realized by the completely integrable N=2 super-KdV systems, whenever the
initial soliton is loaded with other solitons that are virtual and become
manifest through the tau-function as the time grows.
