We explore the physics potential of NuSOnG experiment to probe new physics
contributions to $W\mu\nu_\mu$ couplings in inverse muon decay and charged
current deep inelastic scattering processes. We show that NuSOnG provides two
order of magnitude improvement in $W\mu\nu_\mu$ compared to LEP bound at 95%
C.L.. Combining the results presented here with our earlier results, we obtain
a significant improvement in the limits on neutrino flavor universality
violation in neutrino-W and neutrino-Z couplings.
