We report nanosecond time-resolved photoluminescence measurements on the
isoelectronic series of oxygen deficient centers in amorphous silica,
Si-ODC(II), Ge-ODC(II) and Sn-ODC(II) which are responsible of fluorescence
activities at $\sim$4 eV under excitation at $\sim$5 eV. The dependence of the
first moment of their emission band on time, and that of the radiative decay
lifetime on emission energy are analyzed within a theoretical model able to
describe the effects introduced by disorder on the optical properties of the
defects. We obtain separate estimates of the homogeneous and inhomogeneous
contributions to the measured emission linewidth and we derive homogeneous
spectroscopic features of the investigated point defects (Huangh-Rhys factor,
homogeneous width, oscillator strength, vibrational frequency). The results
point to a picture in which an oxygen deficient center localized on a heavier
atom features a higher degree of inhomogeneity due to stronger local distortion
of the surrounding matrix. For Si, Ge, Sn related defects the parameter
$\lambda$, able to quantify inhomogeneity, results to be 65, 78 and 90$%,
respectively.
