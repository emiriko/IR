We investigate pure dephasing decoherence (free induction decay and spin
echo) of a spin qubit interacting with a nuclear spin bath. While for infinite
magnetic field B the only decoherence mechanism is spectral diffusion due to
dipolar flip-flops of nuclear spins, with decreasing B the hyperfine-mediated
interactions between the nuclear spins become important. We give a theory of
decoherence due to these interactions which takes advantage of their long-range
nature. For a thermal uncorrelated bath we show that our theory is applicable
down to B~10 mT, allowing for comparison with recent experiments in GaAs
quantum dots.
