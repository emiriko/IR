We consider the quantum Hall effect in quantum electrodynamics and find a
deviation from the quantum mechanical prediction for the Hall conductivity due
to radiative antiscreening of electric charge in an external magnetic field. A
weak universal dependence of the von Klitzing constant on the magnetic field
strength, which can possibly be observed in a dedicated experiment, is
predicted.
