The matrix elements connected non physic angles space representation with the
space of physic observables of alternative O(2,4) world found on explicit form.
All such matrix elements are represented in terms of solutions of Gauss
hypergeometric equations. From these results wave function of free moving
particle in alternative world may be constructed. Definite relations between
micro and macro label variables are presented.
