The hard-loop resummed propagator in an anisotropic QCD plasma in general
linear gauges are computed. We get the explicit expressions of the gluon
propagator in covariant gauge, Coulomb gauge and temporal axial gauge.
Considering one gluon exchange, the potential between heavy quarks is defined
through the Fourier transform of the static propagator. We find that the
potential exhibits angular dependence and that there is stronger attraction on
distance scales on the order of the inverse Debye mass for quark pairs aligned
along the direction of anisotropy than for transverse alignment.
