We present the study of CP violation in charm and charmonium decays, using a
data sample corresponding to 657 \times 10^6 BBbar events collected with the
Belle detector at the \Upsilon(4S) resonance at the KEKB asymmetric-energy
e^+e^- collider. We report measurements of the polarization fraction and
time-dependent CP-violation parameters of the decay B^0\to D^{*+}D^{*-} and of
the branching fraction and charge asymmetry in the decay of the Cabibbo- and
color-suppressed process B^{\pm} \to \psi(2S) \pi^{\pm}.
