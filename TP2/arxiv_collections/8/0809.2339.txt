We derive a formula for the light field of a monochromatic plane wave that is
truncated and reflected by a spherical mirror. Our formula is valid even for
deep mirrors, where the aperture radius approaches the radius of curvature. We
apply this result to micro-fabricated mirrors whose size scales are in the
range of tens to hundreds of wavelengths, and show that sub-wavelength spot
sizes can be achieved. This opens up the possibility of scalable arrays of
tightly focused optical dipole traps without the need for high-performance
optical systems.
