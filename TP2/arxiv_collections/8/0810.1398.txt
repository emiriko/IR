The so-called 'LSND anomaly', a 3.8 sigma excess of anti-nu_e events
interpreted as originating from anti-nu_mu -> anti-nu_e oscillation, gave rise
to many theoretical speculations. The MiniBooNE Collaboration reported
inconsistency of this interpretation with the findings from their search for
nu_mu -> nu_e oscillations. Yet the origin of the LSND anomaly was never
clarified. A critical issue is the prediction of the background anti-nu_e flux
that was used in the analysis of the LSND experiment. For this, decisive input
comes from pion spectra measured with the HARP large-angle spectrometer under
conditions that closely resemble the LSND situation: a proton beam with 800 MeV
kinetic energy hitting a water target.
