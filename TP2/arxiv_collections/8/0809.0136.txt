We study the Brownian motion of particles trapped by optical tweezers inside
a colloidal glass (Laponite) during the sol-gel transition. We use two methods
based on passive rheology to extract the effective temperature from the
fluctuations of the Brownian particles. All of them give a temperature that,
within experimental errors, is equal to the heat bath temperature. Several
interesting features concerning the statistical properties and the long time
correlations of the particles are observed during the transition.
