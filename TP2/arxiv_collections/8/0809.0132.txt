Hybrid monolayers of clay minerals (hectorite) and Octadecyamine (ODA) were
prepared using the Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) technique. Surface pressure-area per
molecule isotherm, FTIR and atomic force microscopy were used to confirm and
analyze the ODA-hectorite hybrid films. The monolayer thickness is 2 nm and
average height, length and width of individual clay platelets ranges between
1.5 to 2 nm, 500 to 1250 nm and 100 to 115 nm respectively. The surface
coverage was more than 80%.
