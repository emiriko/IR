We investigated the infrared optical spectra of an organic dimer Mott
insulator $\kappa$-(BEDT-TTF)$_{2}$Cu[N(CN)$_{2}$]Cl, which was irradiated with
X-rays. We observed that the irradiation caused a large spectral weight
transfer from the mid-infrared region, where interband transitions in the dimer
and Mott-Hubbard bands take place, to a Drude part in a low-energy region; this
caused the Mott gap to collapse. The increase of the Drude part indicates a
carrier doping into the Mott insulator due to irradiation defects. The strong
redistribution of the spectral weight demonstrates that the organic Mott
insulator is very close to the phase border of the bandwidth-controlled Mott
transition.
