We analytically calculate the energy spectrum of a circular graphene quantum
dot with radius R subjected to a perpendicular magnetic field B by applying the
infinite-mass boundary condition. We can retrieve well-known limits for the
cases R, B going to infinity and B going to zero. Our model is capable of
capturing the essential details of recent experiments. Quantitative agreement
between theory and experiment is limited due to the fact that a circular dot is
not close enough to the experimental geometry, that disorder plays a
significant role, and that interaction effects may be relevant.
