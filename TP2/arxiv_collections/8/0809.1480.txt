To implement the consistent black hole complementarity principle, we need two
assumptions: first, there exists a singularity near the center, and second,
global horizons are the same as local horizons. However, these assumptions are
not true in general. In this paper, the authors study a charged black hole in
which the second assumption may not hold. From the previous simulations, we
have argued that the event horizon is quite close to the outer horizon, and it
seems not harmful to black hole complementarity; however, the Cauchy horizon
can be different from the inner horizon, and a violation of complementarity
will be possible. To maintain complementarity, we need to assume a selection
principle between the singularity and the Hawking radiation generating surface;
we suggest that Horowitz-Maldacena's proposal can be useful for this purpose.
Finally, we discussed some conditions under which the selection principle may
not work.
