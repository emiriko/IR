We study the Langevin dynamics of a two-dimensional discrete oscillator chain
absorbed on a periodic substrate and subjected to an external localized point
force. Going beyond the commonly used harmonic bead-spring model, we consider a
nonlinear Morse interaction between the next-nearest-neighbors. We focus
interest on the activation of directed motion instigated by thermal
fluctuations and the localized point force. In this context the local
transition states are identified and the corresponding activation energies are
calculated. As a novel feature it is found that the transport of the chain in
point force direction is determined by stepwise escapes of a single unit or
segments of the chain due to the existence of multiple locally stable
attractors. The non-vanishing net current of the chain is quantitatively
assessed by the value of the mobility of the center of mass. It turns out that
the latter as a function of the ratio of the competing length scales of the
system, that is the period of the substrate potential and the equilibrium
distance between two chain units, shows a resonance behavior. More precisely
there exist a set of optimal parameter values maximizing the mobility.
Interestingly, the phenomenon of negative resistance is found, i.e. the
mobility possesses a minimum at a finite value of the strength of the thermal
fluctuations for a given overcritical external driving force.
