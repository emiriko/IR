It is shown how Andrews' multidimensional extension of Watson's
transformation between a very-well-poised $_8\phi_7$-series and a balanced
$_4\phi_3$-series can be used to give a straightforward proof of a conjecture
of Zudilin and the second author on the arithmetic behaviour of the
coefficients of certain linear forms of 1 and Catalan's constant. This proof is
considerably simpler and more stream-lined than the first proof, due to the
second author.
