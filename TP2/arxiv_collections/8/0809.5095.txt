In this article, we calculate the contribution from the nonfactorizable soft
hadronic matrix element to the decay $B^0\to \chi_{c1} \pi^0$ with the
light-cone QCD sum rules. The numerical results show that its contribution is
rather large and should not be neglected. The total amplitudes lead to a
branching fraction which is in agreement with the experimental data marginally.
