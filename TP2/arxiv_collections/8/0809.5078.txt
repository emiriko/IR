Entanglement generated by Ising model has been studied for several authors in
order to understand the relation between it and magnetic properties of
materials, principally using one or two dimensional models for two or more
particles. In this work, Ising model evolution is solved in three dimensions
for two parts including an inhomogeneous magnetic field, giving an detailed
study of the entanglement properties derived from interaction. Some relations
between entanglement and energy or spin are developed specifically to stablish
candidates for entanglement witness. Finally, some basic quantum control
operations are prescripted for this model as to preserve the properties of the
system as for transfer information between the two parts. These last schemes of
control are useful when initial state is completely known, to gain domain on
the system. It prevents to introduce more sophisticated control schemes which
normally are necessary when initial state is at least partially unknown.
