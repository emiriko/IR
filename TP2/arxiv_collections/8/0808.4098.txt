A simplified model of quantum electrodynamics involving a charged two-state
system interacting with an electromagnetic field mode is examined. By extending
the Schrodinger equation to include stochastic and nonlinear terms the
dynamical process of quantum state reduction can be represented. A specific
choice of modified Schrodinger dynamics is shown to result in stable coherent
field states. The two-state system undergoes an induced state reduction to a
generalised current state due to its interaction with the field mode. Numerical
results are presented demonstrating state reduction dynamics for an initial
superposition of two current states. An induced reduction time-scale for the
two-state system is derived and confirmed by the numerics.
