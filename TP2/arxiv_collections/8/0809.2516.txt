Compactification of the 5-dimensional Kaluza-Klein space-time geometry is
considered. The space-time geometry is supposed to be discrete, uniform and
isotropic. It is shown, that consideration of the space-time geometry as a
physical geometry, i.e. as a geometry described completely by the single-valued
world function, leads to a discrimination of some values of the particle
charge. At the conventional approach, when the world function becomes to be
many-valued after compactification, the value of the elementary particle
electric charge remains to be unrestricted, and this fact does not agree with
experimental data. It is important, that the discrete geometry is given on the
continual set of points. This circumstance makes admissible a compatibility of
discreteness with the uniformity and isotropy of the geometry.
