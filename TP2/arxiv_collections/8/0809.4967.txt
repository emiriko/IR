Si(331)-(12x1) is the only confirmed planar silicon surface with a stable
reconstruction located between (111) and (110). We have optimized the annealing
sequence and are able to obtain almost defect free, atomically precise surface
areas approaching micrometer dimensions. The unprecedented perfection of the
surface combined with its pronounced structural anisotropy makes it a promising
candidate to serve as template for the growth of self-assembled one-dimensional
nanostructure arrays.
