We present the most recent measurements of the top quark mass in the dilepton
decay channel at the D0 experiment using proton-antiproton collisions with a
center-of-mass energy of 1.96 TeV at the Tevatron collider. Two different
methods have been used: the Neutrino Weighting and the Matrix Element method.
The combined results yield a top mass of 174.4 +-3.8 GeV.
