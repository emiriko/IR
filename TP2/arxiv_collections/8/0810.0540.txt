We establish some signatures of the extra bilepton boson ${X^0}$ predicted in
the ${SU (3)_C \times SU (3)_L \times U (1)_X}$ model with right-handed
neutrinos. We analyze the process $p + p \longrightarrow X^0 +X^{0*} + {\hbox
{anything}}$, for center of mass energy regime of the Large Hadron Collider.
The main contributions for the neutral bilepton production in $q \bar q$
process come from the $s-$channel ($Z$ and $Z^\prime$ exchanges), when the
initial quarks have charge 2/3, and from an additional $t-$channel (heavy quark
exchange) when they have -1/3 of the positron electric charge. We calculate
some distributions of the final bileptons and from these results we conclude
that LHC can show a clear signature for the existence of the $X^0$ predicted in
the 3-3-1 model.
