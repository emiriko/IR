Let $A$ be an abelian variety over a $p$-adic field $K$ and $L$ an algebraic
infinite extension over $K$. We consider the finiteness of the torsion part of
the group of rational points $A(L)$ under some assumptions. In 1975, Hideo Imai
proved that such a group is finite if $A$ has good reduction and $L$ is the
cyclotomic $\mathbb{Z}_p$-extension of $K$. In this talk, first we show a
generalization of Imai's result in the case where $A$ has ordinary good
reduction. Next we give some finiteness results when $A$ is an elliptic curve
and $L$ is the field generated by the $p$-power torsion of an elliptic curve.
