We study the Sobolev trace constant for functions defined in a bounded domain
$\O$ that vanish in the subset $A.$ We find a formula for the first variation
of the Sobolev trace with respect to hole. As a consequence of this formula, we
prove that when $\O$ is a centered ball, the symmetric hole is critical when we
consider deformation that preserve volume but is not optimal for some case.
