Any object on earth has two fundamental properties: it is finite, and it is
made of atoms. Structural information about an object can be obtained from
diffraction amplitude measurements that account for either one of these traits.
Nyquist-sampling of the Fourier amplitudes is sufficient to image single
particles of finite size at any resolution. Atomic resolution data is routinely
used to image molecules replicated in a crystal structure. Here we report an
algorithm that requires neither information, but uses the fact that an image of
a natural object is compressible. Intended applications include tomographic
diffractive imaging, crystallography, powder diffraction, small angle x-ray
scattering and random Fourier amplitude measurements.
