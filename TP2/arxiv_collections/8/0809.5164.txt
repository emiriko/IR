In this paper the problem of strong solvability of the incompressible
Navier-Stokes equations (INSE) is revisited, with the goal of determining the
minimal assumptions for the validity of a local existence and uniqueness
theorem for the Navier-Stokes fluid fields (solutions of INSE). Emphasis is
placed on fluid fields which, together with suitable derivatives, do not
necessarily decay at infinity and hence do not belong to Sobolev spaces. For
this purpose a novel approach based on a so-called inverse kinetic theory,
recently developed by Tessarotto and Ellero, is adopted. This requires the
construction of a suitable kinetic equation, advancing in time a suitably
smooth kinetic distribution function and providing exactly, as its moment
equations, the complete set of fluid equations. In turn, by proper definition
of the kinetic equation, this permits the introduction of the so-called
\textit{Navier-Stokes dynamical system}, i.e., the dynamical system which
advances in time self-consistently the Navier-Stokes fluid fields.
Investigation of the properties of this dynamical system is crucial for the
establishment of an existence and uniqueness theorem for strong solutions of
INSE. The new theorem applies both to bounded and unbounded domains and in the
presence of generalized boundaries, represented by surfaces, curves or even
sets of isolated points. In particular, for unbounded domains, solutions are
considered, which do not necessarily vanish at infinity. Basic consequences for
the functional setting of classical solutions are analyzed.
