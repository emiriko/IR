We study the steady state of the abelian sandpile models with stochastic
toppling rules. The particle addition operators commute with each other, but in
general these operators need not be diagonalizable. We use their abelian
algebra to determine their eigenvalues, and the Jordan block structure. These
are then used to determine the probability of different configurations in the
steady state. We illustrate this procedure by explicitly determining the
numerically exact steady state for a one dimensional example, for systems of
size $\le12$, and also study the density profile in the steady state.
