We present it ab initio calculations of the electronic energy loss of charged
particles moving outside a magnesium surface, from a realistic description of
the one-electron band structure and a full treatment of the dynamical
electronic response of valence electrons. Our results indicate that the finite
width of the plasmon resonance, which is mainly due to the presence of
band-structure effects, strongly modifies the asymptotic behaviour of the
energy loss at large distances from the surface. This effect is relevant for
the understanding of the interaction between charged particles and the internal
surface of microcapillaries.
