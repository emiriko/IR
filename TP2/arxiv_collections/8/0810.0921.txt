We calculate form factors relevant for rare B decays using moving-NRQCD for
the b quark and the AsqTad action for the light quarks. Moving NRQCD allows us
to work directly with the physical b quark mass and go to higher recoil
momentum compared to standard NRQCD. Here, we show first results for the matrix
elements and the operator matching coefficients. Some difficulties and possible
ways of improvement are discussed.
