We report controlled local manipulation of single vortices by low temperature
magnetic force microscope (MFM) in a thin film of superconducting Nb. We are
able to position the vortices in arbitrary configurations and to measure the
distribution of local depinning forces. This technique opens up new
possibilities for the characterization and use of vortices in superconductors.
