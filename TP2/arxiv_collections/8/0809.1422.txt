We examine the superfluid and collapse instabilities of a quasi
two-dimensional gas of dipolar fermions aligned by an orientable external
field. It is shown that the interplay between the anisotropy of the dipolar
interaction, the geometry of the system, and the p-wave symmetry of the
superfluid order parameter means that the effective interaction for pairing can
be made very large without the system collapsing. This leads to a broad region
in the phase diagram where the system forms a stable superfluid. Analyzing the
superfluid transition at finite temperatures, we calculate the
Berezinskii--Kosterlitz--Thouless temperature as a function of the dipole
angle.
