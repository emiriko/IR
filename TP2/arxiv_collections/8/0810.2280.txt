We consider the recent experiments on He3 bi-layers, showing evidence for a
quantum critical point (QCP) at which the first layer localizes. Using the
Anderson lattice in two dimensions with the addition of a small dispersion of
the f-fermion, we modelize the system of adsorbed He3 layers. The first layer
represents the f-fermions at the brink of localization while the second layer
behaves as a free Fermi sea. We study the quantum critical regime of this
system, evaluate the effective mass in the Fermi liquid phase and the coherence
temperature and give a fit of the experiments and interpret its main features.
Our model can serve as well as a predictive tool used for better determination
of the experimental parameters.
