We study a double quantum dot in the regime where each dot carries a
spin-1/2. This system is described by the 2-impurity Kondo model, having a
non-Fermi liquid fixed point for a critical value of the inter-impurity
coupling. The Hamiltonian describing the vicinity of the critical point,
including the relevant potential scattering perturbations, can be cast in
quadratic form. This allows us to predict a universal scaling function for the
finite temperature nonlinear conductance along the crossover from the critical
point to the surrounding stable fixed points.
