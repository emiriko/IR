By a reformulation of the loop expansion in the Resonance-Spectrum-Expansion
amplitude for meson-meson scattering, in terms of s-channel exchange of
families of propagator modes, we obtain a formalism which allows for a wider
range of applications. The connection with the unitarized amplitudes employed
in some chiral theories is discussed. We also define an alternative for the
Regge spectra and indicate how this may be observed in experiment.
