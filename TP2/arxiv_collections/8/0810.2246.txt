We analyze entanglement generation between a pair of neutral two level atoms
that are initially excited in a common electromagnetic vacuum. The nonlocal
correlations that appear due to the interaction with the field can become
entanglement when the field state is known. We distinguish two different
situations: in the first, the field remains in the vacuum state, and second two
photons are present in the final state. In both cases we study the dependence
of the entanglement with time and interatomic distance, at ranges related with
locality issues.
