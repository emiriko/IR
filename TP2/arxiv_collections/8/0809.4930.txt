In the context of general Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM), new
sources for Lepton Flavor Violation (LFV) as well as CP-violation appear. We
show that in the presence of LFV sources, the electric dipole moment of the
electron ($d_e$) can receive new contributions. In particular, $d_e$ can
receive a significant contribution at one loop level from the phase of the
trilinear $A$-term of the staus, $\phi_{A_\tau}$. We discuss how we can derive
information on $\phi_{A_\tau}$ by combining the information on $d_e$ with that
on the LFV decay modes of the $\tau$ lepton. We then discuss if this approach
can be considered as an alternative to the direct measurement of
$\phi_{A_\tau}$ at ILC.
