It is well known that phase transitions arise if the interaction among
particles embodies an attractive as well as a repulsive contribution. In this
work it will be shown that the breakdown of Lorentz symmetry, characterized
through a deformation in the relation dispersion, plus the bosonic statistics
predict the emergence of critical points. In other words, in some quantum
gravity models the structure of spacetime implies the emergence of critical
points even when no interaction among the particle has been considered.
