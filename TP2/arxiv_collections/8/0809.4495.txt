We show that Einstein's main equations for stationary axisymmetric fields in
vacuum are equivalent to the motion equations for bosonic strings moving on a
special nonflat background. This new representation is based on the analysis of
generalized harmonic maps in which the metric of the target space explicitly
depends on the parametrization of the base space. It is shown that this
representation is valid for any gravitational field which possesses two
commuting Killing vector fields. We introduce the concept of dimensional
extension which allows us to consider this type of gravitational fields as
strings embedded in D-dimensional nonflat backgrounds, even in the limiting
case where the Killing vector fields are hypersurface orthogonal.
