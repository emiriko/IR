We performed a search for a light pseudoscalar particle $X$ in the decay
$K_L^0->pi0pi0X$, $X->\gamma\gamma$ with the E391a detector at KEK. Such a
particle with a mass of 214.3 MeV/$c^2$ was suggested by the HyperCP
experiment. We found no evidence for $X$ and set an upper limit on the product
branching ratio for $K_L^0->pi0pi0X$, $X->\gamma\gamma$ of $2.4 \times 10^{-7}$
at the 90% confidence level. Upper limits on the branching ratios in the mass
region of $X$ from 194.3 to 219.3 MeV/$c^2$ are also presented.
