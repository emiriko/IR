We investigate the theoretical limits of the effect of the quantum
interaction distance on the speed of exact quantum addition circuits. For this
study, we exploit graph embedding for quantum circuit analysis. We study a
logical mapping of qubits and gates of any $\Omega(\log n)$-depth quantum adder
circuit for two $n$-qubit registers onto a practical architecture, which limits
interaction distance to the nearest neighbors only and supports only one- and
two-qubit logical gates. Unfortunately, on the chosen $k$-dimensional practical
architecture, we prove that the depth lower bound of any exact quantum addition
circuits is no longer $\Omega(\log {n})$, but $\Omega(\sqrt[k]{n})$. This
result, the first application of graph embedding to quantum circuits and
devices, provides a new tool for compiler development, emphasizes the impact of
quantum computer architecture on performance, and acts as a cautionary note
when evaluating the time performance of quantum algorithms.
