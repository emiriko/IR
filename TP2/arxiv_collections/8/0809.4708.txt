The direct detection of gravitational waves will provide valuable
astrophysical information about many celestial objects. The SCHENBERG has
already undergone its first test run. It is expected to have its first
scientific run soon. In this work a new data analysis approach is presented,
called method of independent bars, which can be used with SCHENBERG's data . We
test this method through the simulation of the detection of gravitational
waves. With this method we find the source's direction without the need to have
all six transducers operational. Also we show that the method is a
generalization of another one, already described in the literature, known as
the mode channels method.
