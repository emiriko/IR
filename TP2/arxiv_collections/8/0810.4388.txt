We established important relationships between entanglement measures and the
order parameter (spin polarization) in nuclear spin systems controlled by the
nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) technique. Since spin polarization can be
easily manipulated by the NMR technique, experimentalists are presented with an
opportunity to study the dynamic properties of entanglement, i.e., the creation
and evolution of entangled states. Our approach may constitute the basis for
researching the relations between the entanglement measures and measurable
parameters of order in other quantum systems.
