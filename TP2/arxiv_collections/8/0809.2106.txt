We study the properties and production mechanisms of color-octet scalars at
the LHC. We focus on the single production of both charged and neutral members
of an (8,2)_1/2 doublet through bottom quark initial states. These channels
provide a window to the underlying Yukawa structure of the scalar sector.
Color-octet scalars naturally appear in grand unified theories based on the
SU(5) gauge symmetry. In the context of adjoint SU(5) these fields are expected
to be light to satisfy constraints coming from unification and proton decay,
and may have TeV-scale masses. One combination of their couplings is defined by
the relation between the down-quark and charged-lepton Yukawa couplings.
Observation of these states at the LHC gives an upper bound on the proton
lifetime if they truly arise from this grand unified theory. We demonstrate
that TeV-mass scalars can be observed over background at the LHC using boosted
top quark final states, and study how well the scalar Yukawa parameters can be
measured.
