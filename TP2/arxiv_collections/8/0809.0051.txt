Using superconducting quantum circuits, we propose an approach to construct a
Kitaev lattice, i.e., an anisotropic spin model on a honeycomb lattice with
three types of nearest-neighbor interactions. We study two particular cases to
demonstrate topological states (i.e., the vortex and bond states) and show how
the braiding statistics can be revealed. Our approach provides an
experimentally realizable many-body system for demonstrating exotic properties
of topological phases.
