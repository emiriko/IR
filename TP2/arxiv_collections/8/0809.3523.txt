Relational particle models are of value in the absolute versus relative
motion debate. They are also analogous to the dynamical formulation of general
relativity, and as such are useful for investigating conceptual strategies
proposed for resolving the problem of time in quantum general relativity.
Moreover, to date there are few explicit examples of these at the quantum
level. In this paper I exploit recent geometrical and classical dynamics work
to provide such a study based on reduced quantization in the case of pure shape
(no scale) in 2-d for 3 particles (triangleland) with multiple harmonic
oscillator type potentials. I explore solutions for these making use of exact,
asymptotic, perturbative and numerical methods. An analogy to the mathematics
of the linear rigid rotor in a background electric field is useful throughout.
I argue that further relational models are accessible by the methods used in
this paper, and for specific uses of the models covered by this paper in the
investigation of the problem of time (and other conceptual and technical
issues) in quantum general relativity.
