We consider the model of random sequential adsorption, with depositing
objects, as well as those already at the surface, decreasing in size according
to a specified time dependence, from a larger initial value to a finite value
in the large time limit. Numerical Monte Carlo simulations of two-dimensional
deposition of disks and one-dimensional deposition of segments are reported for
the density-density correlation function and gap-size distribution function,
respectively. Analytical considerations supplement numerical results in the
one-dimensional case. We investigate the correlation hole - the depletion of
correlation functions near contact and, for the present model, their vanishing
at contact - that opens up at finite times, as well as its closing and
reemergence of the logarithmic divergence of correlation properties at contact
in the large time limit.
