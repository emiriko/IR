In this paper, we consider the effect of Planck scale operators on electric
dipole moment of the electron de. The electric dipole moment of the electron,
de is known to vanish up to three loops in the standard model with massless
neutrinos We consider the Planck scale operator on neutrino mixing. We assume
that the neutrino masses and mixing arise through physics at a scale
intermediate between Planck scale and the electroweak braking scale. We also
assume, that just above the electroweak breaking scale neutrino mass are nearly
degenerate and the mixing is bi-maximal. Quantum gravity (Planck scale) effects
lead to an effective SU(2)_{L}\times U(1) invariant dimension-5 Lagrangian
symmetry involving Standard Model. On electroweak symmetry breaking, this
operator gives rise to correction to the neutrino masses and mixings these
additional terms can be considered as perturbation to the bimaximal neutrino
mass matrix We assume that the gravitational interaction is flavour blind and
we study the neutrino mixing and electric dipole moment due to the Planck scale
effects.
