There are two incompatible Coq libraries that have a theory of the real
numbers; the Coq standard library gives an axiomatic treatment of classical
real numbers, while the CoRN library from Nijmegen defines constructively valid
real numbers. Unfortunately, this means results about one structure cannot
easily be used in the other structure. We present a way interfacing these two
libraries by showing that their real number structures are isomorphic assuming
the classical axioms already present in the standard library reals. This allows
us to use O'Connor's decision procedure for solving ground inequalities present
in CoRN to solve inequalities about the reals from the Coq standard library,
and it allows theorems from the Coq standard library to apply to problem about
the CoRN reals.
