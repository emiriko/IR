We investigate the dynamics of a two dimensional axial next nearest neighbour
Ising (ANNNI) model following a quench to zero temperature. The Hamiltonian is
given by $H = -J_0\sum_{i,j=1}^L S_{i,j}S_{i+1,j} - J_1\sum_{i,j=1} [S_{i,j}
S_{i,j+1} -\kappa S_{i,j} S_{i,j+2}]$. For $\kappa <1$, the system does not
reach the equilibrium ground state but slowly evolves to a metastable state.
For $\kappa > 1$, the system shows a behaviour similar to the two dimensional
ferromagnetic Ising model in the sense that it freezes to a striped state with
a finite probability. The persistence probability shows algebraic decay here
with an exponent $\theta = 0.235 \pm 0.001$ while the dynamical exponent of
growth $z=2.08\pm 0.01$. For $\kappa =1$, the system belongs to a completely
different dynamical class; it always evolves to the true ground state with the
persistence and dynamical exponent having unique values. Much of the dynamical
phenomena can be understood by studying the dynamics and distribution of the
number of domains walls. We also compare the dynamical behaviour to that of a
Ising model in which both the nearest and next nearest neighbour interactions
are ferromagnetic.
