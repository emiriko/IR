In this paper I discuss nonlinear parabolic systems that are generalizations
of scalar diffusion equations. I show that when potential is a convex function
that depends only on the norm of the solution, then bounded weak solutions of
these parabolic systems are everywhere Holder continuous and thus everywhere
smooth. I also show that the method used to prove this result can be easily
adopted to simplify the proof of the result due to Wiegner on everywhere
regularity of bounded weak solutions of strongly coupled parabolic systems.
