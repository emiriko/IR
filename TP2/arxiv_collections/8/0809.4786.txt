We report on the measurement of the radiation hardness of silicon
photomultipliers (SiPMs) manufactured by
  Fondazione Bruno Kessler in Italy (1 mm$^2$ and 6.2 mm$^2$), Center of
Perspective Technology and Apparatus in Russia (1 mm$^2$ and 4.4 mm$^2$), and
Hamamatsu Corporation in Japan (1 mm$^2$). The SiPMs were irradiated using a
beam of 212 MeV protons at Massachusetts General Hospital, receiving fluences
of up to $3 \times 10^{10}$ protons per cm$^2$ with the SiPMs at operating
voltage. Leakage currents were read continuously during the irradiation. The
delivery of the protons was paused periodically to record scope traces in
response to calibrated light pulses to monitor the gains, photon detection
efficiencies, and dark counts of the SiPMs. The leakage current and dark noise
are found to increase with fluence. Te leakage current is found to be
proportional to the mean square deviation of the noise distribution, indicating
the dark counts are due to increased random individual pixel activation, while
SiPMs remain fully functional as photon detectors. The SiPMs are found to
anneal at room temperature with a reduction in the leakage current by a factor
of 2 in about 100 days.
