We report the first measurement of the low-energy neutron-$^3$He incoherent
scattering length using neutron interferometry: $b_i' = (-2.512\pm
0.012{statistical}\pm0.014{systematic})$ fm. This is in good agreement with a
recent calculation using the AV18+3N potential. The neutron-$^3$He scattering
lengths are important for testing and developing nuclear potential models that
include three nucleon forces, effective field theories for few-body nuclear
systems, and neutron scattering measurements of quantum excitations in liquid
helium. This work demonstrates the first use of a polarized nuclear target in a
neutron interferometer.
