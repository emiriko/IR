Quantum interferometers are generally set so that phase differences between
paths in coordinate space combine constructive or destructively. Indeed, the
interfering paths can also meet in momentum space leading to momentum-space
fringes. We propose and analyze a method to produce interference in momentum
space by phase-imprinting part of a trapped atomic cloud with a detuned laser.
For one-particle wave functions analytical expressions are found for the fringe
width and shift versus the phase imprinted. The effects of unsharpness or
displacement of the phase jump are also studied, as well as many-body effects
to determine the potential applicability of momentum-space interferometry.
