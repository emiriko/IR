A (3+1)-evolutionary method in the framework of Regge Calculus, essentially a
method of approximating manifolds with rigid simplices, makes an excellent tool
to probe the evolution of manifolds with non-trivial topology or devoid of
symmetry. The "Parallelisable Implicit Evolution Scheme" is one such method.
Causality however, is an aspect of this method that has been barely
investigated. In this paper, we show how causality can be accounted for in this
evolutionary scheme. The revised algorithm is illustrated by a preliminary
application to a skeletonised spherical Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker
universe.
