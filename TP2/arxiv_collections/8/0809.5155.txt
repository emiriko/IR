We report $^{57}$Fe-NMR studies on the oxygen-deficient iron (Fe)-based
oxypnictide superconductor LaFeAsO$_{0.7}$ ($T_{c}=$ 28 K) enriched by
$^{57}$Fe isotope. In the superconducting state, the spin component of
$^{57}$Fe-Knight shift $^{57}K$ decreases almost to zero at low temperatures
and the nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate $^{57}(1/T_{1})$ exhibits a
$T^{3}$-like dependence without the coherence peak just below $T_{c}$, which
give firm evidence of the unconventional superconducting state formed by
spin-singlet Cooper pairing. All these events below $T_c$ are consistently
argued in terms of the extended s$_{\pm}$-wave pairing with a sign reversal of
the order parameter among Fermi surfaces. In the normal state, we found the
remarkable decrease of $1/T_1T$ upon cooling for both the Fe and As sites,
which originates from the decrease of low-energy spectral weight of spin
fluctuations over whole ${\bm q}$ space upon cooling below room temperature.
Such behavior has never been observed for other strongly correlated
superconductors where an antiferromagnetic interaction plays a vital role in
mediating the Cooper pairing.
