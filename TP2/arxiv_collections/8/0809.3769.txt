Jet fragmentation functions measured in e^+e^- and p+\bar{p} experiments are
well-described on an inclusive hadron level by QCD-based calculations.
Fragmentation is expected to be modified by the presence of a strongly
interacting medium, but full theoretical description of this modification must
still be developed. It has recently been suggested that particle-identified
fragmentation functions may provide additional insight into the processes
underlying jet quenching. To assess the applicability of QCD-based
fragmentation calculations to RHIC data, and to provide a baseline with which
to compare fragmentation function measurements in heavy ion collisions, we
present the first measurements of charged hadron and particle-identified
fragmentation functions of jets reconstructed via a midpoint-cone algorithm
from p+p collisions at 200 GeV in STAR. We study the dependence on jet
cone-size and jet-energy, and compare the results to PYTHIA simulations based
on the Modified Leading Log Approximation (MLLA).
