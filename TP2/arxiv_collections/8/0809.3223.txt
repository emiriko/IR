We propose that the properties of glass transition can be understood on the
basis of elastic waves. Elastic waves originating from atomic jumps in a liquid
propagate local expansion due to the anharmonicity of interatomic potential.
This creates dynamic compressive stress, which increases the activation barrier
for other events in a liquid. The non-trivial point is that the range of
propagation of high-frequency elastic waves, $d_{\rm el}$, increases with
liquid relaxation time $\tau$. A self-consistent calculation shows that this
increase gives the Vogel-Fulcher-Tammann (VFT) law. In the proposed theory, we
discuss the origin of two dynamic crossovers in a liquid: 1) the crossover from
exponential to non-exponential and from Arrhenius to VFT relaxation at high
temperature and 2) the crossover from the VFT to a more Arrhenius-like
relaxation at low temperature. The corresponding values of $\tau$ at the two
crossovers are in quantitative parameter-free agreement with experiments. The
origin of the second crossover allows us to reconcile the ongoing controversy
surrounding the possible divergence of $\tau$. The crossover to Arrhenius
relaxation universally takes place when $d_{\rm el}$ reaches system size, thus
avoiding divergence and associated theoretical complications such as
identifying the nature of the phase transition and the second phase itself.
Finally, we discuss the effect of volume on $\tau$ and the origin of liquid
fragility.
