Recent results of searches for leptoquarks, lepton flavour violating
leptoquarks and excited fermions (electrons, neutrinos and quarks) with the H1
experiment at HERA are presented, which use up to the full ep H1 data set. No
evidence for the direct or indirect production of such particles is found. The
results are interpreted in terms of limits on the Yukawa coupling of
leptoquarks and lepton flavour violating processes and for excited fermions on
the ratio of the coupling parameter to the compositeness scale f/Lambda, mainly
in the framework of gauge mediated interactions. The derived limits extend the
excluded regions to higher masses than those reported in previous results.
