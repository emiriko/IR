The radial part of the effective mass Klein-Gordon equation for the Hulthen
potential is solved by making an approximation to the centrifugal potential.
The Nikiforov-Uvarov method is used in the calculations. Energy spectra and the
corresponding eigenfunctions are computed. Results are also given for the case
of constant mass.
