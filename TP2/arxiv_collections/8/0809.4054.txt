Let $u:\R \times \R^n \to \C$ be the solution of the linear Schr\"odinger
equation $iu_t + \Delta u =0$ with initial data $u(0,x) = f(x)$. In the first
part of this paper we obtain a sharp inequality for the Strichartz norm
$\|u(t,x)\|_{L^{2k}_tL^{2k}_x(\R \times\R^n)}$, where $k\in \Z$, $k \geq 2$ and
$(n,k) \neq (1,2)$, that admits only Gaussian maximizers. As corollaries we
obtain sharp forms of the classical Strichartz inequalities in low dimensions
(works of Foschi and Hundertmark - Zharnitsky) and also sharp forms of some
Sobolev-Strichartz inequalities. In the second part of the paper we express
Foschi's sharp inequalities for the Schr\"odinger and wave equations in the
broader setting of sharp restriction/extension estimates for the paraboloid and
the cone.
