We report on potential for measurement of W and Z boson production
accompanied by jets at the CMS experiment. Of particular interest are jet
multiplicity and Pt distributions. The 10/pb to 100/pb datasets expected in the
startup year of operation of LHC are likely to already provide information
beyond the reach of the Tevatron collider both in jet multiplicity and Pt
range. We are especially interested in understanding the ratios of W+jets to
Z+jets distributions by comparing them to next-to-leading order Monte Carlo
generators, as these processes present a formidable background for searches of
new physics phenomena.
