We present a pseudospin model which should be experimentally accessible using
solid-state devices and, being a variation on the compass model, adds to the
toolbox for the protection of qubits in the area of quantum information. Using
Monte Carlo methods, we find for both classical and quantum spins in two and
three dimensions Ising-type Neel ordering of energy fluctuations at finite
temperatures without magnetic order. We also readdress the controversy
concerning the stability of the ordered state in the presence of quenched
impurities and present numerical results which are at clear variance with
earlier claims in the literature.
