We review the theoretical behaviour of the total and one-particle structure
factors at a quantum phase transition for temperature T=0. The predictions are
compared with exact or numerical results for the transverse Ising model, the
alternating Heisenberg chain, and the bilayer Heisenberg model. At the critical
wavevector, the results are generally in accord with theoretical expectations.
Away from the critical wavevector, however, different models display quite
different behaviours for the one-particle residues and structure factors.
