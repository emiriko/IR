In this paper we demonstrate the use of intelligent optimization
methodologies on the visualization optimization of virtual / simulated
environments. The problem of automatic selection of an optimized set of views,
which better describes an on-going simulation over a virtual environment is
addressed in the context of the RoboCup Rescue Simulation domain. A generic
architecture for optimization is proposed and described. We outline the
possible extensions of this architecture and argue on how several problems
within the fields of Interactive Rendering and Visualization can benefit from
it.
