We study the global existence issue for the two-dimensional Boussinesq system
with horizontal viscosity in only one equation. We first examine the case where
the Navier-Stokes equation with no vertical viscosity is coupled with a
transport equation. Second, we consider a coupling between the classical
two-dimensional incompressible Euler equation and a transportdiffusion equation
with diffusion in the horizontal direction only. For the both systems and for
arbitrarily large data, we construct global weak solutions `a la Leray. Next,
we state global wellposedness results for more regular data. Our results
strongly rely on the fact that the diffusion occurs in a direction
perpendicular to the buoyancy force.
