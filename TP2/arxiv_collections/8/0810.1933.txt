In order to advance lattice calculations of moments of unpolarized, helicity,
and transversity distributions, electromagnetic form factors, and generalized
form factors of the nucleon to a new level of precision, this work investigates
several key aspects of precision lattice calculations. We calculate the number
of configurations required for constant statistical errors as a function of
pion mass, describe the coherent sink method to help achieve these statistics,
examine the statistical correlations between separate measurements, study
correlations in the behavior of form factors at different momentum transfer,
examine volume dependence, and compare mixed action results with those using
comparable dynamical domain wall configurations. We also show selected form
factor results and comment on the QCD evolution of our calculations of the
flavor non-singlet nucleon angular momentum.
