Several physical natures of charged brane-world black holes have been
investigated. At first, time-like and null geodesics of the charged brane-world
black holes are presented. We also analyze all the possible motions by plotting
the effective potentials for various parameters for circular and radial
geodesics. Secondly, we investigate the motion of test particles in the
gravitational field of charged brane-world black holes using Hamilton-Jacobi
(H-J) formalism. We have considered charged and uncharged test particles and
examine its behavior both in static and non-static cases. Thirdly,
thermodynamics of the charged brane-world black holes are studied. Finally, it
has been also shown that there is no phenomenon of superradiance for an
incident massless scalar field for this black hole.
