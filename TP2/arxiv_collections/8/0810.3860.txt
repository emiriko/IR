In this paper, we give a new method for proving the Lesche stability of
several functionals(Incomplete entropy, Tsallis entropy, \kappa - entropy,
Quantum-Group entropy). We prove also that the Incomplete q - expectation value
and Renyi entropy for (0 < q < 1) are \alpha - stable for all (0 <\alpha <= q).
Finally, we prove that the Incomplete q - expectation value is \alpha - stable
for all 0 <\alpha <=1.
