We present a feasibility study of a method to measure the cosine of twice the
CKM Unitarity Triangle angle beta using a time-dependent Dalitz plot analysis
of B0 -> D pi+ pi- decays, where the neutral D meson is reconstructed in decays
to CP eigenstates. We show that this method can be used at the B factories to
make a measurement of cos(2beta) that is competitive with, or more precise
than, other techniques using different quark-level transitions, while
sin(2beta) can be measured to an accuracy more precise than any existing
measurement using b -> c ubar d transitions. Furthermore, this technique has
great potential to be employed at LHCb.
