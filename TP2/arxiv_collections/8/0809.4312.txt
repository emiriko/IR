We investigate a modification in the action of inflaton due to
noncommutativity leads to a nonstandard initial vacuum and oscillatory
corrections in the initial power spectrum. We show that the presence of these
oscillations causes a drop in the WMAP $\chi^{2}$ about $\Delta\chi^{2}\sim
8.5$. As a bonus, from the parameter estimation done in this work, we show that
the noncommutative parameters can be precisely bound to $10^{16}$ GeV or
$10^{4}$ GeV depending on the inflation scale.
