Assuming that initial velocity has finite energy and initial vorticity is
bounded in the plane, we show that for any finite time interval the unique
solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations converge uniformly to the unique
solution of the Euler equations as viscosity approaches zero. We also establish
a rate of convergence.
