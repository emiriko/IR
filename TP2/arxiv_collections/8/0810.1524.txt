Phenomenology of uncolored iquarks - hypothetical fermions charged under a
new confining unbroken non-abelian gauge group as well as the standard
electroweak gauge group - is investigated for the iquark mass in the range near
and above 100 GeV. If the new confining scale turns out to be higher than MeV
but much less than the iquark mass, the iquark-antiiquark pair produced in the
collider will promptly relaxed into the ground state of the iquarkonium.
Subsequent pair annihilation into standard model particles gives useful
information of the iquark dynamics. We formulate in details production and
decays of the iquark-antiiquark bound states. Decay patterns of the iquarkonium
can be distinguished from the superheavy quarkonium of a sequential fourth
generation of quarks with degenerate mass.
