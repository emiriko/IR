After Laskar, the Lyapunov time in the solar system is about five millions
years (5.000.000 [years]). On the other hand, after Kimura, the evolutionary
(phenotypic) rate, for hominids, is 1/5.000.000 [1/years]. Why are these two
quantities so closely related? In this work, following a proposition by
Finlayson and Hutchings et al, I found an inequality, which relates Lyapunov
time and evolution rate. This inequality fits well with some known cases in
biological evolution.
