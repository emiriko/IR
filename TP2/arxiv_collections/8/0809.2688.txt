With the growing use of new technologies, healthcare is nowadays undergoing
significant changes. Information-based medicine has to exploit medical
decision-support systems and requires the analysis of various, heterogeneous
data, such as patient records, medical images, biological analysis results,
etc. In this paper, we present the design of the complex data warehouse
relating to high-level athletes. It is original in two ways. First, it is aimed
at storing complex medical data. Second, it is designed to allow innovative and
quite different kinds of analyses to support: (1) personalized and anticipative
medicine (in opposition to curative medicine) for well-identified patients; (2)
broad-band statistical studies over a given population of patients.
Furthermore, the system includes data relating to several medical fields. It is
also designed to be evolutionary to take into account future advances in
medical research.
