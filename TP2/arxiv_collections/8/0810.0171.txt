We discuss the properties of devices of small Josephson junctions in the
light of the phase fluctuation theory and the energy band structure, which
arises from the delocalization of the phase variable. The theory is applied in
the realization of a mesoscopic amplifier, the Bloch oscillating transistor.
The device characteristics and comparison with theory and simulations are
discussed. The current gain of the device in a stable operating mode has been
measured to be as high as 30. Measurements on input impedance and the power
gain show that the BOT is an amplifier designed for middle-range impedances,
ranging from 100 k$\Omega$ - 10 M$\Omega$.
