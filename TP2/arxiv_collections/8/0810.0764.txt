In this paper we wish to introduce a method to reconstruct large size Welch
Bound Equality (WBE) codes from small size WBE codes. The advantage of these
codes is that the implementation of ML decoder for the large size codes is
reduced to implementation of ML decoder for the core codes. This leads to a
drastic reduction of the computational cost of ML decoder. Our method can also
be used for constructing large Binary WBE (BWBE) codes from smaller ones.
Additionally, we explain that although WBE codes are maximizing the sum channel
capacity when the inputs are real valued, they are not necessarily appropriate
when the input alphabet is binary. The discussion shows that when the input
alphabet is binary, the Total Squared Correlation (TSC) of codes is not a
proper figure of merit.
