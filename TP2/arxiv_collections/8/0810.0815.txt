The functional method to derive the fractional Fokker-Planck equation for
probability distribution from the Langevin equation with Levy stable noise is
proposed. For the Cauchy stable noise we obtain the exact stationary
probability density function of Levy flights in different smooth potential
profiles. We find confinement of the particle in the superdiffusion motion with
a bimodal stationary distribution for all the anharmonic symmetric monostable
potentials investigated. The stationary probability density functions show
power-law tails, which ensure finiteness of the variance. By reviewing recent
results on these statistical characteristics, the peculiarities of Levy flights
in comparison with ordinary Brownian motion are discussed.
