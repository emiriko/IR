The modification of hard jets in dense matter has so far been described by
four different formalisms based on perturbative QCD (pQCD). In these
proceedings, we compare the various approximations made in these different
schemes, especially those regarding the structure of the medium through which
jets propagate. Following this, we highlight some of the major differences in
the various physical processes contained in the different approaches.
