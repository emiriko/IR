We expose superconducting nanowires to microwave radiation in order to study
phase lock-in effects in quasi one dimensional superconductors. For
sufficiently high microwave powers a resistive branch with Shapiro steps
appears in the voltage-current characteristics. At frequencies in the range of
0.9-4 GHz these steps are of integer order only. At higher frequencies steps of
1/2, 1/3, 1/4 and even 1/6 order appear. We numerically model this behavior
using a multi-valued current-phase relationship (CPR) for nanowires.
