We prove the equivariant Gromov-Witten theory of a nonsingular toric 3-fold X
with primary insertions is equivalent to the equivariant Donaldson-Thomas
theory of X. As a corollary, the topological vertex calculations by Agangic,
Klemm, Marino, and Vafa of the Gromov-Witten theory of local Calabi-Yau toric
3-folds are proven to be correct in the full 3-leg setting.
