The 3He(alpha,gamma)7Be process is a key reaction in both Big-Bang
nucleosynthesis and p-p chain of Hydrogen Burning in Stars. A new measurement
of the 3He(alpha,gamma)7Be cross section has been performed at the INFN Gran
Sasso underground laboratory by both the activation and the prompt gamma
detection methods. The present work reports full details of the prompt gamma
detection experiment, focusing on the determination of the systematic
uncertainty. The final data, including activation measurements at LUNA, are
compared with the results of the last generation experiments and two different
theoretical models are used to obtain the S-factor at solar energies.
