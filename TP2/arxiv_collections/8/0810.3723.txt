A model-independent global search for new physics has been performed at the
CDF experiment. This search examines nearly 400 final states, looking for
discrepancies between the observed data and the standard model expectation in
populations, kinematic shapes, and the tails of the summed transverse momentum
distributions. A new approach also searches in approximately 5000 mass
variables looking for `bumps' that may indicate resonant production of new
particles. The results of this global search for new physics in 2/fb are
presented. In addition, a model-independent search for deviations from the
Standard Model prediction is performed in e+p and e-p collisions at HERA II
using all H1 data recorded during the second running phase. This corresponds to
integrated luminosities of 178/pb and 159/pb for e+p and e-p collisions,
respectively. A statistical algorithm is used to search for deviations in the
distributions of the scalar sum of transverse momenta or invariant mass of
final state particles, and to quantify their significance.
