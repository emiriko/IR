The paper reports on the comparison of the wetting properties of
super-hydrophobic silicon nanowires (NWs), using drop impact impalement and
electrowetting (EW) experiments. A correlation between the resistance to
impalement on both EW and drop impact is shown. From the results, it is evident
that when increasing the length and density of NWs: (i) the thresholds for drop
impact and EW irreversibility increase (ii) the contact-angle hysteresis after
impalement decreases. This suggests that the structure of the NWs network could
allow for partial impalement, hence preserving the reversibility, and that EW
acts the same way as an external pressure. The most robust of our surfaces show
a threshold to impalement higher than 35 kPa, while most of the
super-hydrophobic surfaces tested so far have impalement threshold smaller than
10 kPa.
