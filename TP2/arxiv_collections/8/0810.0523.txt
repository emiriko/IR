Results are given from a density matrix renormalization group study of
pairing on a striped $t$-$t'$-$J$ lattice in the presence of boundary magnetic
and pair fields. We find that pairing on a stripe depends sensitively on both
$J/t$ and $t'/t$. In the strong-pairing model-parameter regime the stripes are
easily coupled by the pair field, and have a uniform phase. There is a small
but measurable energy cost to create anti-phase superconducting domain walls.
