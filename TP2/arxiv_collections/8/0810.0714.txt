A new theory of WIMP Dark Matter has been proposed, motivated directly by
striking Data from the PAMELA and ATIC collaborations. The WIMP is taken to be
charged under a hidden gauge symmetry G_Dark, broken near the GeV scale; this
also provides the necessary ingredients for the "exciting" and "inelastic" Dark
Matter interpretations of the INTEGRAL and DAMA signals. In this short note we
point out the consequences of the most straightforward embedding of this simple
picture within low-energy SUSY, in which G_Dark breaking at the GeV scale
arises naturally through radiative corrections, or Planck-suppressed operators.
The theory predicts major additions to SUSY signals at the LHC. A completely
generic prediction is that G_Dark particles can be produced in cascade decays
of MSSM superpartners, since these end with pairs of MSSM LSP's that in turn
decay into the true LSP and other particles in the dark sector. In turn, the
lightest GeV-scale dark Higgses and gauge bosons eventually decay back into
light SM states, and dominantly into leptons. Therefore, a large fraction of
all SUSY events will contain at least two ``lepton jets'': collections of n>= 2
leptons, with small angular separations and GeV scale invariant masses.
Furthermore, if the Dark Matter sector is directly charged under the Standard
Model, the success of gauge coupling unification implies the presence of new
long-lived colored particles that can be copiously produced at the LHC.
