The validity of using a pion optical potential to incorporate the effects of
final state interactions on HBT interferometry is investigated. We find that if
the optical potential is real, the standard formalism is modified as previously
described in the literature. However, if the optical potential is complex, a
new term involving pion emission from eliminated states must be included. The
size of such effects in previous work by Cramer and Miller is assessed.
