W. Thurston proved that to a triangulation of the sphere of non-negative
combinatorial curvature, one can associate an element in a certain lattice over
the Eisenstein integers such that its orbit is a complete invariant of the
triangulation. In this paper, we show that this association can be obtained
naturally by using Type III degenerations of K3 surfaces.
