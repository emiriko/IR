We discuss black hole solutions with a Gauss-Bonnet term in the bulk and an
induced gravity term on a thin brane of codimension-2. We show that these black
holes can be localized on the brane, and they can be extended further into the
bulk by a warp function. These solutions have regular horizons and no other
curvature singularities appear apart from the string-like ones. The projection
of the Gauss-Bonnet term on the brane imposes a constraint relation which
dictates the form of matter on the brane and in the bulk.
