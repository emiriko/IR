We present theoretical study of morphology of Fe islands grown at Mo(110)
surface in sub-monolayer MBE mode. We utilize atomistic SOS model with bond
counting, and interactions of Fe adatom up to third nearest neighbors. We
performed KMC simulations for different values of adatom interactions and
varying temperatures. We have found that, while for the low temperature islands
are fat fractals, for the temperature 500K islands have faceted rhombic-like
shape. For the higher temperature, islands acquire a rounded shape. In order to
evaluated qualitatively morphological changes, we measured averaged aspect
ration of islands. We calculated dependence of the average aspect ratio on the
temperature, and on the strength of interactions of an adatom with neighbors.
