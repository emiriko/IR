In 1972, P.W.Anderson suggested that `More is Different', meaning that
complex physical systems may exhibit behavior that cannot be understood only in
terms of the laws governing their microscopic constituents. We strengthen this
claim by proving that many macroscopic observable properties of a simple class
of physical systems (the infinite periodic Ising lattice) cannot in general be
derived from a microscopic description. This provides evidence that emergent
behavior occurs in such systems, and indicates that even if a `theory of
everything' governing all microscopic interactions were discovered, the
understanding of macroscopic order is likely to require additional insights.
