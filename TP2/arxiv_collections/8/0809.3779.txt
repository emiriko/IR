We discuss the collisional formation of Efimov trimers via ultracold
four-body recombination. In particular, we consider the reaction A+A+A+B->A3+B
with A and B ultracold atoms. We obtain expressions for the four-body
recombination rate and show that it reflects the three-body Efimov physics
either as a function of collision energy or as a function of the two-body
s-wave scattering length between A atoms. In addition, we briefly discuss
issues important for experimentally observing this interesting and relatively
unexplored process.
