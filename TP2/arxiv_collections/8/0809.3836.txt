We present a numerical study of fractional quantum Hall liquid at Landau
level filling factor $\nu=2/3$ in a microscopic model including long-range
Coulomb interaction and edge confining potential, based on the disc geometry.
We find the ground state is accurately described by the particle-hole conjugate
of a $\nu=1/3$ Laughlin state. We also find there are two counter-propagating
edge modes, and the velocity of the forward-propagating mode is larger than the
backward-propagating mode. The velocities have opposite responses to the change
of the background confinement potential. On the other hand changing the
two-body Coulomb potential has qualitatively the same effect on the velocities;
for example we find increasing layer thickness (which softens of the Coulomb
interaction) reduces both the forward mode and the backward mode velocities.
