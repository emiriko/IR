Coalitional games are mathematical models suited to analyze scenarios where
players can collaborate by forming coalitions in order to obtain higher worths
than by acting in isolation. A fundamental problem for coalitional games is to
single out the most desirable outcomes in terms of appropriate notions of worth
distributions, which are usually called solution concepts. Motivated by the
fact that decisions taken by realistic players cannot involve unbounded
resources, recent computer science literature reconsidered the definition of
such concepts by advocating the relevance of assessing the amount of resources
needed for their computation in terms of their computational complexity. By
following this avenue of research, the paper provides a complete picture of the
complexity issues arising with three prominent solution concepts for
coalitional games with transferable utility, namely, the core, the kernel, and
the bargaining set, whenever the game worth-function is represented in some
reasonable compact form (otherwise, if the worths of all coalitions are
explicitly listed, the input sizes are so large that complexity problems
are---artificially---trivial). The starting investigation point is the setting
of graph games, about which various open questions were stated in the
literature. The paper gives an answer to these questions, and in addition
provides new insights on the setting, by characterizing the computational
complexity of the three concepts in some relevant generalizations and
specializations.
