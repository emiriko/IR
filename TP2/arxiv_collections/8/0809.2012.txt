We investigate the parameter space of the minimal supersymmetric Standard
Model (MSSM) where the gluino and squark masses are much above 1 TeV but the
remaining part of the sparticle spectrum is accessible to the Large Hadron
Collider at CERN. After pointing out that such a scenario may constitute an
important benchmark of gaugino/scalar non-universality, we find that
hadronically quiet trileptons are rather useful signals for it. Regions of the
parameter space, where the signal is likely to be appreciable, are identified
through a detailed scan. The advantage of hadronically quiet trileptons over
other types of signals is demonstrated.
