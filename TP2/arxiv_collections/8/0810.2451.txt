We discuss the ground state of a disordered two dimensional Heisenberg
antiferromagnet. The starting structure is taken to be a perfectly
deterministic quasiperiodic tiling, and the type of disorder we consider is
geometric, involving frozen phason flips of a randomly selected subset of
sites. We consider S=1/2 quantum spins placed on the vertices of the tiling,
and interacting with the nearest neighbor spins with a uniform exchange
interaction J. We calculate the energy spectrum, ground state energy and real
space local magnetization values as a function of degree of disorder. We find
that quantum fluctuations are enhanced by disorder. The real space staggered
magnetization loses its symmetry properties and the average staggered
magnetization decreases compared to the case of the perfect Penrose tiling. We
explain our results in terms of a simple Heisenberg star cluster model that
takes into account the changes of local environments due to phason flips.
