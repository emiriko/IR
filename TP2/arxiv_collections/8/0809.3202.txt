The electric quadrupole moment and the magnetic moment of the 11Li halo
nucleus have been measured with more than an order of magnitude higher
precision than before, |Q| = 33.3(5)mb and mu=3.6712(3)mu_N, revealing a
8.8(1.5)% increase of the quadrupole moment relative to that of 9Li. This
result is compared to various models that aim at describing the halo
properties. In the shell model an increased quadrupole moment points to a
significant occupation of the 1d orbits, whereas in a simple halo picture this
can be explained by relating the quadrupole moments of the proton distribution
to the charge radii. Advanced models so far fail to reproduce simultaneously
the trends observed in the radii and quadrupole moments of the lithium
isotopes.
