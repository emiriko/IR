The (3p - 1s) X-ray transition to the muonic hydrogen ground state was
measured with a high resolution crystal spectrometer. A Doppler effect
broadening of the X-ray line was established which could be attributed to
different Coulomb de-excitation steps preceding the measured transition. The
assumption of a statistical population of the hyperfine levels of the muonic
hydrogen ground state was directly confirmed by the experiment and measured
values for the hyperfine splitting can be reported. The results allow a
decisive test of advanced cascade model calculations and establish a method to
extract fundamental strong-interaction parameters from pionic hydrogen
experiments.
