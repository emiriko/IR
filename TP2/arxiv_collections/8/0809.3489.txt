The van der Waals forces across a very thin liquid layer (nanofilm) in
contact with a plane solid wall make the liquid nonhomogeneous. The dynamics of
such flat liquid nanofilms is studied in isothermal case. The Navier-Stokes
equations are unable to describe fluid motions in very thin films. The notion
of surface free energy of a sharp interface separating gas and liquid layer is
disqualified. The concept of disjoining pressure replaces the model of surface
energy. In the nanofilm a supplementary free energy must be considered as a
functional of the density. The equation of fluid motions along the nanofilm is
obtained through the Hamilton variational principle by adding, to the
conservative forces, the forces of viscosity in lubrication approximation. The
evolution equation of the film thickness is deduced and takes into account the
variation of the disjoining pressure along the layer.
