An alternative model for the dissociation of the J/psi is proposed. Chiral
symmetry is properly implemented. Abnormal parity interactions and mesonic form
factors naturally arise from the underlying quark sub-structure. Analytic
confinement for the light quarks is generated by appropriately chosen the quark
interaction kernels. Dissociation cross sections of the J/psi by either a pion
or a rho meson are then evaluated and discussed.
