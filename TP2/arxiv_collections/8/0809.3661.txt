We propose a scheme for long-distance quantum communication where the
elementary entanglement is generated through two-photon interference and
quantum swapping is performed through one-photon interference. Local
"polarization" maximally entangled states of atomic ensembles are generated by
absorbing a single photon from on-demand single-photon sources. This scheme is
robust against phase fluctuations in the quantum channels, moreover speeds up
long-distance high-fidelity entanglement generation rate.
