The infrared behavior of gluon and ghost propagators offers a crucial test of
confinement scenarios in Yang-Mills theories. A nonperturbative study of these
propagators from first principles is possible in lattice simulations, but one
must consider significantly large lattice sizes in order to approach the
infrared limit. We propose constraints based on general properties of the
propagators to gain control over the extrapolation of data to the
infinite-volume limit. These bounds also provide a way to relate the
propagators to simpler, more intuitive quantities. We apply our analysis to the
case of pure SU(2) gauge theory in Landau gauge, using the largest lattice
sizes to date. Our results seem to contradict commonly accepted confinement
scenarios. We argue that it is not so.
