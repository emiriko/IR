We sketch the proposal for a "PVLAS-Phase II" experiment. The main physics
goal is to achieve the first direct observation of non-linear effects in
electromagnetism predicted by QED and the measurement of the photon-photon
scattering cross section at low energies (1-2 eV). Physical processes such as
ALP and MCP production in a magnetic field could also be accessible if
sensitive enough operation is reached. The short term experimental strategy is
to compact as much as possible the dimensions of the apparatus in order to
bring noise sources under control and to attain a sufficient sensitivity. We
will also briefly mention future pespectives, such as a scheme to implement the
resonant regeneration principle for the detection of ALPs.
