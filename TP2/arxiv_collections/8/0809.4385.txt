By using extended bosonic coherent states, a new technique to solve the Dicke
model exactly is proposed in the numerical sense. The accessible system size is
two orders of magnitude higher than that reported in literature. Finite-size
scaling for several observables, such as the ground-state energy, Berry phase,
and concurrence are analyzed. The existing discrepancy for the scaling exponent
of the concurrence is reconciled.
