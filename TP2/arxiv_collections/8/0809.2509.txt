We calculate the renormalization constants of the N=1, N=2, N=4
supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories in an arbitrary covariant gauge in the
dimensional reduction scheme up to three loops. We have found, that the
beta-functions for N=1 and N=4 SYM theories are the same from the different
triple vertices. This means that the dimensional reduction scheme works
correctly in these models up to third order of perturbative theory.
