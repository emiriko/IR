There is a group-theoretical connection between fermion mixing matrices and
minimal horizontal symmetry groups. Applying this connection to the
tri-bimaximal neutrino mixing matrix, we show that the minimal horizontal
symmetry group for leptons is uniquely $S_4$, the permutation group of four
objects.
