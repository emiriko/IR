It is well known that global symmetries protect local supersymmetry and a
zero value for the cosmological constant in no--scale supergravity. A
particular breakdown of these symmetries, which ensures the vanishing of the
vacuum energy density, leads to the natural realisation of the multiple point
principle (MPP). In the MPP inspired SUGRA models the cosmological constant is
naturally tiny.
