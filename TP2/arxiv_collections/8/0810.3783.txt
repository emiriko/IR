In this paper, we propose a new distributed algorithm, called Directed
Transmission Method (DTM). DTM is a fully asynchronous and continuous-time
iterative algorithm to solve SPD sparse linear system. As an architecture-aware
algorithm, DTM could be freely running on all kinds of heterogeneous parallel
computer. We proved that DTM is convergent by making use of the final-value
theorem of Laplacian Transformation. Numerical experiments show that DTM is
stable and efficient.
