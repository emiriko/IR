Recent searches for physics beyond the standard model at high-energy
colliders are reviewed, with emphasis on supersymmetry, additional space
dimensions, extra gauge bosons, leptoquarks, and model-independent searches.
The results reported are based on data samples of up to 0.5 and 2.5 fb-1
collected at HERA and at the Tevatron, respectively.
