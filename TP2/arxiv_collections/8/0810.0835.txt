The structure and the magnetic properties of an InGaAs/Fe3Si superlattice in
a cylindrical geometry are investigated by electron microscopy techniques,
x-ray diffraction and magnetometry. To form a radial superlattice, a
pseudomorphic InGaAs/Fe3As bilayer has been released from its substrate
self-forming into a rolled-up microtube. Oxide-free interfaces as well as areas
of crystalline bonding are observed and an overall lattice mismatch between
succeeding layers is determined. The cylindrical symmetry of the final radial
superlattice shows a significant effect on the magnetization behavior of the
rolled-up layers.
