The relativistic four-quark equations are found in the framework of
coupled-channel formalism. The dynamical mixing of the meson-meson states with
the four-quark states is considered. The four-quark amplitudes of the
tetraquarks with hidden charm including u, d, s and charmed quarks are
constructed. The poles of these amplitudes determine the masses and widths of
tetraquarks.
