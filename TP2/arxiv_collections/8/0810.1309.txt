We explore manganite interface magnetism in epitaxially grown
La0.7Sr0.3MnO3(LSMO)/SrTiO3 ultrathin superlattices (SL) along (110)
orientation. we show that robust ferromagnetism persists down to four
monolayers LSMO(MLs) (~1.1 nm in thickness), of which 50% Mn is at the
interface state. Above eight MLs, the magnetic moment is nearly saturated to
the theoretical value of 3.7u_B, with an estimated interface moment of 3.2u_B.
In comparison to (100)-oriented SLs which were previously shown to have a spin
canted ground state, (110)-oriented SLs exhibit stronger low-dimensional
ferromagnetism and better metallicity, suggesting a ferromagnetic interface
spin state well suited for all-oxide spintronic devices. The underlining
mechanism is qualitatively discussed.
