Quantum computers promise dramatic speed ups for many computational tasks.
For large-scale quantum computation however, the inevitable coupling of
physical qubits to the noisy environment imposes a major challenge for a
real-life implementation. A scheme introduced by Gottesmann and Chuang can help
to overcome this difficulty by performing universal quantum gates in a
fault-tolerant manner. Here, we report a non-trivial demonstration of this
architecture by performing a teleportation-based two-qubit controlled-NOT gate
through linear optics with a high-fidelity six-photon interferometer. The
obtained results clearly prove the involved working principles and the
entangling capability of the gate. Our experiment represents an important step
towards the feasibility of realistic quantum computers and could trigger many
further applications in linear optics quantum information processing.
