Coherent control and the creation of entangled states are discussed in a
system of two superconducting flux qubits interacting with each other through
their mutual inductance and identically coupling to a reservoir of harmonic
oscillators. We present different schemes using continuous-wave control fields
or Stark-chirped rapid adiabatic passages, both of which rely on a dynamic
control of the qubit transition frequencies via the external bias flux in order
to maximize the fidelity of the target states. For comparison, also special
area pulse schemes are discussed. The qubits are operated around the optimum
point, and decoherence is modelled via a bath of harmonic oscillators. As our
main result, we achieve controlled robust creation of different Bell states
consisting of the collective ground and excited state of the two-qubit system.
