We present results for the first two moments of the light-cone distribution
amplitudes of the pion and kaon pseudo-scalar mesons and of the rho, K* and phi
vector mesons. The calculations are performed on the RBC/UKQCD collaborations'
ensembles generated with the Iwasaki gauge action and with 2+1 flavours of
domain wall fermions. In addition we also provide some results on the necessary
non-perturbative renormalisation which we perform using the Rome-Southampton
method. We discuss the benefits of the momentum source approach such as much
smaller statistical errors and the possibility to see effects of the
discretisation.
