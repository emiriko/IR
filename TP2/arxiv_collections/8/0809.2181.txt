In the gauge-Higgs unification scenario 4D Higgs fields are unified with
gauge fields in higher dimensions. The electroweak model is constructed in the
Randall-Sundrum warped space. The electroweak symmetry is dynamically broken by
the Hosotani mechanism due to the top quark contribution. The Higgs mass is
predicted to be around 50 GeV with the vanishing ZZH and WWH couplings so that
the LEP2 bound for the Higgs mass is evaded.
