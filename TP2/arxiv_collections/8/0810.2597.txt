We discuss the strong rational connectedness of smooth rationally connected
surfaces. We prove in lots of cases, including the smooth locus of a log del
Pezzo surface, the rational connectedness indeed implies the strong rational
conectedness. This confirms a conjecture due to Hassett and Tschinkel in
\cite{ht08}.
