A neighborliness property of marginal polytopes of hierarchical models,
depending on the cardinality of the smallest non-face of the underlying
simplicial complex, is shown. The case of binary variables is studied
explicitly, then the general case is reduced to the binary case. A Markov basis
for binary hierarchical models whose simplicial complexes is the complement of
an interval is given.
