This paper is devoted to the evaluation of the energy-momentum density
components for the Friedmann models. For this purpose, we have used
M${\o}$ller's pseudotensor prescription in General Relativity and a certain
energy-momentum density developed from his teleparallel formulation. It is
shown that the energy density of the closed Friedmann universe vanishes on the
spherical shell at the radius $\rho=2\sqrt{3}$. This coincides with the earlier
results available in the literature. We also discuss the energy of the flat and
open models. A comparison shows a partial consistency between the M${\o}$ller's
pseudotensor for General Relativity and teleparallel theory. Further, it is
shown that the results are independent of the free dimensionless coupling
constant of the teleparallel gravity.
