The influence of radiation reaction (RR) on multiphoton Thomson scattering by
an electron colliding head-on with a strong laser beam is investigated in a new
regime, in which the momentum transferred on average to the electron by the
laser pulse approximately compensates the one initially prepared. This
equilibrium is shown to be far more sensitive to the influence of RR than
previously studied scenarios. As a consequence RR can be experimentally
investigated with currently available laser systems and the underlying widely
discussed theoretical equations become testable for the first time.
