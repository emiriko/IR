We derive asymptotically optimal upper bounds on the number of L-rational
torsion points on a given elliptic curve or Drinfeld module defined over a
finitely generated field K, as a function of the degree [L:K]. Our main tool is
the adelic openness of the image of Galois representations attached to elliptic
curves and Drinfeld modules, due to Serre and Pink-Ruetsche, respectively. Our
approach is to prove a general result for certain Galois modules, which applies
simultaneously to elliptic curves and to Drinfeld modules.
