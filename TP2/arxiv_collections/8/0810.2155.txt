We explore the consequences of an electroweak symmetry breaking sector which
exhibits approximately scale invariant dynamics -- i.e., nontrivial fixed point
behavior, as in unparticle models. One can think of an unHiggs as a composite
Higgs boson with a continuous mass distribution. We find it convenient to
represent the unHiggs in terms of a Kallen-Lehmann spectral function, from
which it is simple to verify the generation of gauge boson and fermion masses,
and unitarization of WW scattering. We show that a spectral function with broad
support, which corresponds to approximate fixed point behavior over an extended
range of energy, can lead to an effectively invisible Higgs particle, whose
decays at LEP or LHC could be obscured by background.
