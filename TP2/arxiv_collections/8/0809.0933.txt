We perform the first study for the bound states of colored scalar particles
$\phi$ ("scalar quarks") in terms of mass generation with quenched SU(3)$_c$
lattice QCD. We investigate the bound states of $\phi$, $\phi^\dagger\phi$ and
$\phi\phi\phi$ ("scalar-quark hadrons"), as well as the bound states of $\phi$
and quarks $\psi$, i.e., $\phi^\dagger\psi$, $\psi\psi\phi$ and $\phi\phi\psi$
("chimera hadrons"). All these new-type hadrons including $\phi$ have a large
mass of several GeV due to large quantum corrections by gluons, even for zero
bare scalar-quark mass $m_\phi=0$ at $a^{-1}\sim 1{\rm GeV}$. We find a similar
$m_\psi$-dependence between $\phi^\dagger\psi$ and $\phi\phi\psi$, which
indicates their similar structure due to the large mass of $\phi$. From this
study, we conjecture that all colored particles generally acquire a large
effective mass due to dressed gluons.
