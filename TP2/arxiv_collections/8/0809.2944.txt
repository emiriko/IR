The distributional form of the Maxwell-Vlasov equations are formulated.
Submanifold distributions are analysed and the general submanifold
distributional solutions to the Vlasov equations are given. The properties
required so that these solutions can be a distributional source to Maxwell's
equations are analysed and it is shown that a sufficient condition is that
spacetime be globally hyperbolic. The cold fluid, multicurrent and water bag
models of charge are shown to be particular cases of the distributional
Maxwell-Vlasov system.
