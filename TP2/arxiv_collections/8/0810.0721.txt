We present the status and update of a new approach to quantum general
relativity as formulated by Feynman from the Einstein-Hilbert action wherein
amplitude-based resummation techniques are applied to the theory's loop
corrections to yield results (superficially) free of ultraviolet(UV)
divergences. Recent applications are summarized.
