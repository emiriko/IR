The Dirac hydrogen atom with spin symmetry is shown has a SO(4) symmetry. The
generators are derived, and the corresponding Casimir operator leads to the
energy spectrum naturally. This type hydrogen atom is connected to a
four-dimensional Dirac system with equal scalar and vector harmonic oscillator
potential, by the Kustaanheimo-Stiefel transformation with a constraint.
