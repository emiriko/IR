The thermal efficiency of the kinesin cycle at stalling is presently a matter
of some debate, with published predictions ranging from 0 (A. W. C. Lau, D.
Lacoste and K. Mallick, Phys. Rev. Lett. 99, 158102 (2007); D. Lacoste, A. W.
C. Lau and K. Mallick, Phys. Rev. E78, 011915 (2008)) to 100% (G. Oster and H.
Wang, in Molecular Motors, edited by M. Schliwa (Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH,
Weinheim (2003), p. 207). In this note we attemp to clarify the issues
involved. We also find an upper bound on the kinesin efficieny by constructing
an ideal kinesin cycle to which the real cycle may be compared. The ideal cycle
has a thermal efficiency of less than one, and the real one is less efficient
than the ideal one always, in compliance with Carnot's theorem.
