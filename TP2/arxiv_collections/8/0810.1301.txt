The link between low-energy CP violation and leptogenesis became more
accessible with the understanding of flavor effects. However, a definite
well-motivated model where such a link occurs was still lacking. Adjoint SU(5)
is a simple grand unified theory where neutrino masses are generated through
the Type I and Type III seesaw mechanisms, and the lepton asymmetry is
generated by the fermionic triplet responsible for the Type III seesaw. We
focus exclusively on the case of inverted hierarchy for neutrinos, and we show
that successful flavored leptogenesis in this theory strongly points towards
low-energy CP violation. Moreover, since the range of allowed masses for the
triplet is very restricted, we find that the discovery at the LHC of new states
present in the theory, together with proton decay and unification of gauge
couplings, can conspire to provide a hint in favor of leptogenesis.
