A study of collective behavior in heavy ion collisions provides one of the
most sensitive and promising probes for investigation of possible formation of
new extreme state of strong interacting matter and elucidating its properties.
Systematic of experimental results for final state azimuthal anisotropy is
presented for heavy ion interactions at RHIC. Experimental data for azimuthal
anisotropy indicate that the final state strongly interacting matter under
extreme conditions behaves as near-ideal liquid rather, than ideal gas of
quarks and gluons. The strong quenching of jets and the dramatic modification
of jet-like azimuthal correlations, observed in ${Au+Au}$ collisions, are
evidences of the extreme energy loss of partons traversing matter which
contains a large density of color charges. For the first time, dependence of
the jet suppression on orientation of a jet with respect to the reaction plane
is found at RHIC experimentally. The model of compound collective flow and
corresponding analytic approach are discussed. The possible violations of
$\cal{P}$ and $\cal{CP}$ symmetries of strong interactions in heavy ion
collisions at different initial energies are considered. Thus, now the fact is
established firmly, that extremely hot and dense matter created in relativistic
heavy ion collisions at RHIC differs dramatically from everything that was
observed and investigated before.
