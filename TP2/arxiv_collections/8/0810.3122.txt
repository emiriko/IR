We define and compute hyperbolic coordinates and associated foliations which
provide a new way to describe the geometry of the standard map. We also
identify a uniformly hyperbolic region and a complementary 'critical' region
containing a smooth curve of tangencies between certain canonical 'stable'
foliations.
