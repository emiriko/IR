We have measured the low frequency critical current noise in
Nb/AlO$_{\mathrm{x}}$/Nb Josephson junctions. Unshunted junctions biased above
the gap voltage and resistively shunted junctions biased near the critical
current, $I_{c}$, have been measured. For both, the spectral density of $\delta
I_{c}/I_{c}$, $S_{i_{c}}(f)$, is proportional to $1/f$, scales inversely as the
area, $A$, and is independent of $J_{c} \equiv I_{c}/A$ over a factor of nearly
20 in $J_{c}$. For all devices measured at 4.2 K, $S_{i_{c}}$(1 Hz)$= 2.0 \pm
0.4 \cdot 10^{-12}$/Hz when scaled to A=1 $\mu$m$^{2}$. We find that, from 4.2
K to 0.46 K, $S_{i_{c}}(f)$ decreases linearly with temperature.
