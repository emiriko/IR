Valgrind is a widely used framework for dynamic binary instrumentation and
its mostly known by its memcheck tool. Valgrind's code generation module is far
from producing optimal code. In addition it has many backends for different CPU
architectures, which difficults code optimization in an architecture
independent way. Our work focused on identifying sub-optimal code produced by
Valgrind and optimizing it.
