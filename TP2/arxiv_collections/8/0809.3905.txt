In the framework of the LSDA+U method electronic structure and magnetic
properties of the intermetallic compound Gd2Fe17 for both rhombohedral and
hexagonal phases have been calculated. On top of that, ab initio exchange
interaction parameters within the Fe sublattice for all present nearest and
some next nearest Fe ions have been obtained. It was found that for the first
coordination sphere direct exchange interaction is ferromagnetic. For the
second coordination sphere indirect exchange interaction is observed to be
weaker and of antiferromagnetic type. Employing the theoretical values of
exchange parameters Curie temperatures Tc of both hexagonal and rhombohedral
phases of Gd2Fe17 within Weiss mean-field theory were estimated. Obtained
values of Tc and its increase going from the hexagonal to rhombohedral crystal
structure of Gd2Fe17 agree well with experiment. Also for both structures
LSDA+U computed values of total magnetic moment coincide with experimental
ones.
