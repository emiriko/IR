A particle-hole model is developed to describe the excitation spectrum of
single lambda hypernuclei and the possible presence of collective effects is
explored by making a comparison with the mean-field calculations. Results for
the spectra of 12C, 16O, 40Ca, 90Zr and 208Pb single lambda hypernuclei are
shown. The comparison with the available experimental data is satisfactory. We
find that collective phenomena are much less important in hypernuclei than in
ordinary nuclei.
