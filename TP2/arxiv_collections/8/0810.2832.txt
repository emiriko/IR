We report quantum dynamics calculations of the O + OH -> H + O2 reaction on
two different representations of the electronic ground state potential energy
surface (PES) using a time-independent quantum formalism based on
hyperspherical coordinates. Calculations show that several excited vibrational
levels of the product O2 molecule are populated in the reaction. Rate
coefficients evaluated using both PESs were found to be very sensitive to the
energy resolution of the reaction probability, especially at temperatures lower
than 100 K. It is found that the rate coefficient remains largely constant in
the temperature range 10-39 K, in agreement with the conclusions of a recent
experimental study [Carty et al., J. Phys. Chem. A 110, 3101 (2006)]. This is
in contrast with the time-independent quantum calculations of Xu et al. [J.
Chem. Phys. 127, 024304 (2007)] which, using the same PES, predicted two orders
of magnitude drop in the rate coefficient value from 39 K to 10 K. Implications
of our findings to oxygen chemistry in the interstellar medium are discussed.
