We study the influence of disorder strength on the interface roughening
process in a phase-field model with locally conserved dynamics. We consider two
cases where the mobility coefficient multiplying the locally conserved current
is either constant throughout the system (the two-sided model) or becomes zero
in the phase into which the interface advances (one-sided model). In the limit
of weak disorder, both models are completely equivalent and can reproduce the
physical process of a fluid diffusively invading a porous media, where
super-rough scaling of the interface fluctuations occurs. On the other hand,
increasing disorder causes the scaling properties to change to intrinsic
anomalous scaling. In the limit of strong disorder this behavior prevails for
the one-sided model, whereas for the two-sided case, nucleation of domains in
front of the invading front are observed.
