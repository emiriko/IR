A theory of photoinduced directed bending of non-crystalline molecular films
is presented. Our approach is based on elastic deformation of the film due to
interaction between molecules ordered through polarized light irradiation. The
shape of illuminated film is obtained in the frame of the nonlinear elasticity
theory. It is shown that the shape and the curvature of the film depend on the
polarization and intensity of the light. The curvature of an irradiated film is
a non-monotonic function of the extinction coefficient.
