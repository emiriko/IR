We present a generic algorithm for computing discrete logarithms in a finite
abelian p-group H, improving the Pohlig-Hellman algorithm and its
generalization to noncyclic groups by Teske. We then give a direct method to
compute a basis for H without using a relation matrix. The problem of computing
a basis for some or all of the Sylow p-subgroups of an arbitrary finite abelian
group G is addressed, yielding a Monte Carlo algorithm to compute the structure
of G using O(|G|^0.5) group operations. These results also improve generic
algorithms for extracting pth roots in G.
