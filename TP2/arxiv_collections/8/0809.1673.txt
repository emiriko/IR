The spin of an electron in a self-assembled InAs/GaAs quantum dot molecule is
optically prepared and measured through the trion triplet states. A
longitudinal magnetic field is used to tune two of the trion states into
resonance, forming a superposition state through asymmetric spin exchange. As a
result, spin-flip Raman transitions can be used for optical spin
initialization, while separate trion states enable cycling transitions for
non-destructive measurement. With two-laser transmission spectroscopy we
demonstrate both operations simultaneously, something not previously
accomplished in a single quantum dot.
