The use of Pade Approximants for the analysis of the pion vector form-factor
is discussed and justified in this talk. The method is tested first in a
theoretical model and applied then on real experimental data. It is shown how
the Pade Approximants provide a convenient and reliable framework to
incorporate both low and high energy information in the euclidean region,
leading to improved determinations of the low energy parameters such as, e.g.,
the quadratic radius <r^2>^pi_V.
