During fast locomotion - gallop, half bound - of quadruped mammals, the
ground contact of the limbs in each pair do not alternate symmetrically.
Animals using such asymmetrical gait thus choose whether the left or the right
limb will contact the ground first, and this gives rise to limb preference.
Here, we report that dogs (Mammalia, Carnivora) and pikas (Mammalia,
Lagomorpha) prefer one forelimb as trailing limb and use it as such almost
twice as often as the other. We also show that this choice depends on the
individual and is not a characteristic of the species, and that the strength of
the preference was not dependent on the animal's running speed.
