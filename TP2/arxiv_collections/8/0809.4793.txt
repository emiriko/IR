The extension of Dirac's LNH to cover cosmological and fine-structure
time-varying "constants", and the rotation of the Universe, is here analysed,
including a "derivation" of the angular speed of the present Universe, and of
the inflationary phase. Criticizable points on the present calculation, are
clarified.
