In this paper, we construct grammian-like quasideterminant solutions of a
non-Abelian Hirota-Miwa equation. Through continuum limits of this non-Abelian
Hirota-Miwa equation and its quasideterminant solutions, we construct a cascade
of noncommutative differential-difference equations ending with the
noncommutative KP equation. For each of these systems the quasideterminant
solutions are constructed as well.
