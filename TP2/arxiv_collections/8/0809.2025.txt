We study the dynamics of the Jaynes-Cummings Model for two level systems (or
qubits) interacting with a quantized single mode electromagnetic cavity (or
`quantum bus'). We show that there is a time in between the collapse and
revival of Rabi oscillations when the state of the qubit sub-system, $|
\psi\_{attractor} $, is largely independent of its initial state. This
generalizes to many qubits the discovery by Gea-Banacloche for the one qubit
case. The qubits in such `attractor' states are not entangled either with the
field or among themselves, even if they were in the initial state. Subsequently
the entanglement between the qubits revives. Finally, it is argued that the
collapse and revival of entanglement and the persistence of `non-classicality'
is a generic feature of multiple qubits interacting via a `quantum bus'.
