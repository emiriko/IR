Two atomic layers of Ni condensed onto Pb films behave, according to
anomalous Hall effect measurements, as magnetic dead layers. However, the Ni
lowers the superconducting T_{c} of the Pb film. This has lead to the
conclusion that the Ni layers are still very weakly magnetic. In the present
paper the electron dephasing due to the Ni has been measured by weak
localization. The dephasing is smaller by a factor 100 than the pair-breaking.
This proves that the T_{c}-reduction in the PbNi films is not due magnetic Ni
moments.
