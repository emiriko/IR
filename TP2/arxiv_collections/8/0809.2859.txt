We summarize the predictions for the radiative decays l_j->l_i \gamma within
the context of the supersymmetric type II seesaw mechanism considering
universal boundary conditions for the soft SUSY breaking terms. The dependence
on the low-energy neutrino parameters is discussed and the deviations from the
analytical results for large $\tan\beta$ analyzed.
