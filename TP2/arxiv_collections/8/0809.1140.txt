We evaluate quasinormal mode frequencies for RN black hole space times with
cosmic string perturbed by a massless Dirac field, using P\"{o}schl-Teller
potential method. We find that only in the case of RN black hole having small
charge, the effect due to cosmic string will dominate when perturbed by a
negatively charged Dirac field, but if we are perturbing with positively
charged Dirac field decay will be less in the case of black hole having cosmic
string compared to the RN black hole without string
