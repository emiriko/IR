We summarise the status of an intriguing new duality between planar maximally
helicity violating scattering amplitudes and light-like Wilson loops in N=4
super Yang-Mills. In particular, we focus on the role played by (dual)
conformal symmetry, which is made predictive by deriving anomalous conformal
Ward identities for the Wilson loops. Assuming the duality, the conformal
symmetry of the dual Wilson loops becomes an unexpected new symmetry of
scattering amplitudes in N=4 SYM.
