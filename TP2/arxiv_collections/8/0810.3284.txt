Events containing W or Z bosons with accompanying jets are important channels
to test the Standard Model. These proceedings discuss W/Z+Jets production cross
section measurements and their use to understand the detectors and their
performances after the LHC start-up. At the same time, these processes are a
major source of background to new physics searches, such as SUSY. Methods,
mostly data-driven, to identify these events as signals and backgrounds to
searches will be presented.
