We analyze the existence of community structures in two different social
networks obtained from similarity and collaborative features between musical
artists. Our analysis reveals some characteristic organizational patterns and
provides information about the driving forces behind the growth of the
networks. In the similarity network, we find a strong correlation between
clusters of artists and musical genres. On the other hand, the collaboration
network shows two different kinds of communities: rather small structures
related to music bands and geographic zones, and much bigger communities built
upon collaborative clusters with a high number of participants related through
the period the artists were active. Finally, we detect the leading artists
inside their corresponding communities and analyze their roles in the network
by looking at a few topological properties of the nodes.
