The paper contains the generalization of usual lattice model of
multicomponent systems. The generalization is related to account the following
factors: 1. The short-range parts of interatomic repulsions. These repulsions
are not identical for different pairs of atoms, therefore it is impossible to
take into account the repulsions by means of usual ideal lattice introduction.
2. The long-range interatomic potentials take into account by means of
effective fields approximation. 3. The presence the interatomic potentials
depending on some inner degrees of freedoms such as atomic electric and/or
magnetic momentum. The Helmholtz free energy functional in the generalized
lattice model is reduced to the Ginzburg-Landau-Cahn-Hilliard-like (GLCH) form.
The connection between the interatomic potentials characteristics and the
parameters of the GLCH-like functional is obtained. The equations for both full
and partial equilibrium distributions of the species in multicomponent systems
are derived.
