The limitations and possibilities that the concept of quantum interference
offers as a tool for testing fundamental physics are explored here. The use of
neutron interference as an instrument to confront against measurement readouts
some of the principles behind metric theories of gravity will be analyzed, as
well as some discrepancies between theory and experiment. The main restrictions
that this model embodies for the study of some of the features of the structure
of space--time will be explicitly pointed out. For instance, the conditions
imposed by the necessary use of the semiclassical approximation. Additionally,
the role that photon interference could play as an element in this context is
also considered. In this realm we explore the differences between first-order
and second-order coherence experiments, and underline the fact that the
Hanbury--Brown--Twiss effect could open up some interesting experimental
possibilities in the analysis of the structure of space--time. The void, in
connection with the description of wave phenomena, implicit in the principles
of metric theories is analyzed. The conceptual difficulties, that this void
entails, are commented.
