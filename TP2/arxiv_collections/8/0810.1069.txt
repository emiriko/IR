We report the first gigahertz clocked decoy-protocol quantum key distribution
(QKD). Record key rates have been achieved thanks to the use of
self-differencing InGaAs avalanche photodiodes designed specifically for high
speed single photon detection. The system is characterized with a secure key
rate of 1.02 Mbit/s for a fiber distance of 20 km and 10.1 kbit/s for 100 km.
As the present advance relies upon compact non-cryogenic detectors, it opens
the door towards practical and low cost QKD systems to secure broadband
communication in future.
