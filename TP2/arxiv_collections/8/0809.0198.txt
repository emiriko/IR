The parameters of many-body potentials for Co, Nb and Zr metals, based on the
embedded-atom method, have been systematically derived. The analytical
potential scheme allows us to reproduce correctly the cohesive energies and
structural properties of the pure metals and selected alloys making use of a
small set of parameters. With a pair potential going smoothly to zero for a
sufficient cutoff radius, radial partial and bond angular distribution
functions for Co, Nb, Zr and alloys are computed using molecular dynamics
simulations that ensure good quantitative agreement with the available
experimental data up to the melting point. Atomic short range order is analysed
in the light of consecutive Gaussian function decomposition and
Honeycutt-Andersen indices.
