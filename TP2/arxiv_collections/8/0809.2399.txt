We find a two-parameter family of coupled Painlev\'e systems in dimension
four with affine Weyl group symmetry of type $A_4^{(2)}$. For a degenerate
system of $A_4^{(2)}$ system, we also find a one-parameter family of coupled
Painlev\'e systems in dimension four with affine Weyl group symmetry of type
$A_1^{(1)}$. We show that for each system, we give its symmetry and holomorphy
conditions. These symmetries, holomorphy conditions and invariant divisors are
new. Moreover, we find a one-parameter family of partial differential systems
in three variables with $W(A_1^{(1)})$-symmetry. We show the relation between
its polynomial Hamiltonian system and an autonomous version of the system of
type $A_1^{(1)}$.
