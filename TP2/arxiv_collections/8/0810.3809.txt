We consider the general situation of a compact relativistic body with
anisotropic pressures in the presence of the electromagnetic field. The
equation of state for the matter distribution is linear and may be applied to
strange stars with quark matter. Three classes of new exact solutions are found
to the Einstein-Maxwell system. This is achieved by specifying a particular
form for one of the gravitational potentials and the electric field intensity.
We can regain anisotropic and isotropic models from our general class of
solution. A physical analysis indicates that the charged solutions describe
realistic compact spheres with anisotropic matter distribution. The equation of
state is consistent with dark energy stars and charged quark matter
distributions. The masses and central densities correspond to realistic stellar
objects in the general case when anisotropy and charge are present.
