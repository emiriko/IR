We show that a nuclear Hamiltonian and a set of internucleon correlation
functions is in a one-to-one correspondence. The correlation functions for
$s$-shell nuclei interacting via the two-nucleon interaction of AV8$^\prime$
type are calculated to exhibit the importance of tensor correlations as well as
short-range central correlation. The asymptotic behavior of the correlation
functions is also discussed.
