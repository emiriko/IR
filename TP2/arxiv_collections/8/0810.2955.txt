In this paper, the approach for investigation of asymptotic ($Re\to \infty$)
scaling exponents of Eulerian structure functions (J. Schumacher et al, New. J.
of Physics {\bf 9}, 89 (2007)) is generalized to studies of Lagrangian
structure functions in turbulence. The novel "bridging relation" based on the
derived expression for the fluctuating, moment-order - dependent dissipation
time $\tau_{\eta,n}$ enabled us to calculate scaling exponents ($\kappa_{n}$)
of the moments of Lagrangian velocity differences
$S_{n,L}(\tau)=\bar{(u(t+\tau)-u(t))^{n}}\propto \tau^{\kappa_{n}}$ in a good
agreement with experimental and numerical data.
