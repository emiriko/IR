Quantum cryptography (QC) can provide unconditional secure communication
between two authorized parties based on the basic principles of quantum
mechanics. However, imperfect practical conditions limit its transmission
distance and communication speed. Here we implemented the differential phase
shift (DPS) quantum key distribution (QKD) with up-conversion assisted hybrid
photon detector (HPD) and achieved 1.3 M bits per second secure key rate over a
10-km fiber, which is tolerant against the photon number splitting (PNS)
attack, general collective attacks on individual photons, and any other known
sequential unambiguous state discrimination (USD) attacks.
