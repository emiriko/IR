In this paper we analyze the effects of virtual vector bileptons in polarized
Bhabha scattering at the energies of the future linear colliders. In order to
make the calculations of the differential cross sections more realistic,
important beam effects such as initial state radiation, beamstrahlung, beam
energy and polarization spreads are accounted for. The finite resolution of a
typical electromagnetic calorimeter planned for the new linear colliders is
also considered in the simulation. The 95% confidence level limits for bilepton
masses in 331 models are evaluated.
