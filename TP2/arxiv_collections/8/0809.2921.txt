The enhanced spin Hall effect in Au metal due to the resonant skew scattering
is studied with first-principles band structure calculations. Especially the
gigantic spin Hall angle $\gamma_S \cong 0.1$ observed recently (T.Seki et al.,
Nature Materials {\bf 7}, 125 (2008)) is attributed to the orbital-dependent
Kondo effect of Fe in the Au host metal, where the $t_{2g}$-orbitals are in the
mixed-valence region while $e_g$-orbitals are in the Kondo limit. The enhanced
spin-orbit interaction by the electron correlation in the $t_{2g}$-orbitals
leads to the gigantic spin Hall effect. Impurities with 5d orbitals are also
discussed.
