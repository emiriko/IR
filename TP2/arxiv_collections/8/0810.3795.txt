We compute quark and gluon propagators in 2-colour QCD at large baryon
chemical potential mu. The gluon propagator is found to be antiscreened at
intermediate mu and screened at large mu. The quark propagator is drastically
modified in the superfluid region as a result of the formation of a superfluid
gap.
