We will probe the intrinsic behavior of spin susceptibility chi_(spin) in the
LaFeAsO(1-x)F(x) superconductor (x ~ 0.1, Tc ~ 27K) using 19-F and 75-As NMR
techniques. Our new results firmly establish the pseudo-gap behavior with
Delta_(PG)/kB ~ 140K. The estimated magnitude of chi_(spin) at 290K,
~1.8x10^(-4) [emu/mol-Fe], is approximately twice larger than that in high Tc
cuprates. We also show that chi_(spin) levels off below ~50K down to Tc.
