We report on a search for large extra spatial dimensions in the dielectron
and diphoton channels using a data sample of 1.05 \invfb of \ppb collisions at
a center-of-mass energy of 1.96 TeV collected by the D0 detector at the
Fermilab Tevatron Collider. The invariant mass spectrum of the data agrees well
with the prediction of the standard model. We find 95% C.L. lower limits on the
effective Planck scale between 2.1 and 1.3 TeV for 2 to 7 extra dimensions.
