We write out the explicit form of the metric for a linearized gravitational
wave in the transverse-traceless gauge for any multipole, thus generalizing the
well-known quadrupole solution of Teukolsky. The solution is derived using the
generalized Regge-Wheeler-Zerilli formalism developed by Sarbach and Tiglio.
