We show that optical properties of linear molecular aggregates undergo
drastic changes when aggregates are deposited on a metal surface. The
dipole-dipole interactions of monomers with their images can result in strong
{re-structuring of both the exciton band and the absorption spectrum, depending
on the arrangement of the monomer transition dipoles with respect to the
surface.
