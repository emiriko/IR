In this paper, the generalized Bloch Conjecture on zero cycles for the
quotient of certain complete intersections with trivial canonical bundle is
proved to hold. As an application of Bloch-Srinivas method on the decomposition
of the diagonal, we compute the rational coefficient Lawson homology for
1-cycles and codimension two cycles for these quotient varieties. The
(Generalized) Hodge Conjecture is proved to hold for codimension two cycles
(and hence also for 2-cycles) on these quotient varieties.
