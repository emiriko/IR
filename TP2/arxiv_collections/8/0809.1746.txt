The effect of Entanglement Sudden Death (ESD) can arise when entangling
interactions convert purely bipartite entangled states into more generally
entangled states. As a result, ESD can also be seen as a function of
partitioning of the system, not just of time, as the system partitioning
defines different (multipartite) entanglement classes. Computing both geometric
entanglement hierarchies and the generalization of concurrence allows one to
demonstrate that different methods of analysing quantum correlations provide
both qualitative and quantitatively different descriptions of two commonly
cited examples of ESD. These results follow directly from the inequivalence of
entanglement and quantum correlations, the later of which can exist in a state
without the former.
