The form of a local Clifford (LC, also called local Gaussian (LG)) operation
for the continuous-variable (CV) weighted graph states is presented in this
paper, which is the counterpart of the LC operation of local complementation
for qubit graph states. The novel property of the CV weighted graph states is
shown, which can be expressed by the stabilizer formalism. It is distinctively
different from the qubit weighted graph states, which can not be expressed by
the stabilizer formalism. The corresponding graph rule, stated in purely graph
theoretical terms, is described, which completely characterizes the evolution
of CV weighted graph states under this LC operation. This LC operation may be
applied repeatedly on a CV weighted graph state, which can generate the
infinite LC equivalent graph states of this graph state. This work is an
important step to characterize the LC equivalence class of CV weighted graph
states.
