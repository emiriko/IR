The optically induced oscillatory response of a spherical two-component,
shell-core structured, nanoparticle by nodeless elastic vibrations of soft
peripheral shell against hard and dynamically immobile inner core is
considered. The eigenfrequencies of the even-parity, spheroidal and odd-parity
torsional vibrational modes trapped in the finite-depth shell are obtained
which are of practical interest for modal specification of individual
resonances in spectra of resonant scattering of long wavelength electromagnetic
waves by ultrafine particles.
