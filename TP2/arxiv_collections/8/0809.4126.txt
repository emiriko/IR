The target asymmetry for electroproduction of vector mesons is investigated
within the handbag approach. While the generalized parton distribution (GPD) H
is taken from a previous analysis of the elctroproduction cross section, we
here construct the GPD E from double distributions and constrain it by the
Pauli form factors of the nucleon, positivity bounds and sum rules. Predictions
for the target asymmetry are given for various vector mesons and discussed how
experimental data on the asymmetry will further constrain E and what we may
learn about the angular momenta the partons carry.
