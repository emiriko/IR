In this paper we present a comprehensive formalism for dilepton production
from the collision of two polarized spin-$\tfrac{1}{2}$ hadrons by identifying
the general angular distribution of the cross section in combination with a
complete set of structure functions. The various structure functions are
computed in the parton model approximation where we mainly consider the case
when the transverse momentum of the dilepton pair is much smaller than its
invariant mass. In this kinematical region dilepton production can be described
in terms of transverse momentum dependent parton distributions.
