Isolated human buccal epithelium cell were irradiated by microwaves at
frequency f=35 GHz and surface power density E=30 mcW/cm2. The state of
chromatin in human cells was determined by methodsof light and electron
microscopy. The state of cell membranes was evaluated by the method of vital
indigo carmine staining. The microwave-induced condensation of chromatin in
human cells was revealed. Left side circulary polarized waves induced less
effect than linearly polarized radiation. The linearly polarized
electromagnetic waves induced cell membrane damage revealed by the increase of
cell stainability. The data obtained are discussed in connection with the
mechanisms of biologica effect of electromagnetic waves.
