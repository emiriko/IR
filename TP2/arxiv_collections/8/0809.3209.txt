A compact cryogenic Kerr microscope for operation in the small volume of
high-field magnets is described. It is suited for measurements both in Voigt
and Faraday configuration. Coupled with a pulsed laser source, the microscope
is used to measure the time-resolved Kerr rotation response of semiconductor
microstructures with ~1 micron spatial resolution. The microscope was designed
to study spin transport, a critical issue in the field of spintronics. It is
thus possible to generate spin polarization at a given location on a
microstructure and probe it at a different location. The operation of the
microscope is demonstrated by time-resolved measurements of micrometer distance
diffusion of spin polarized electrons in a GaAs/AlGaAs heterojunction quantum
well at 4.2 K and 7 Tesla.
