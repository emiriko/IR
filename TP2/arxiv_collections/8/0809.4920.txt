Embedded systems are playing an increasingly important role in control
engineering. Despite their popularity, embedded systems are generally subject
to resource constraints and it is therefore difficult to build complex control
systems on embedded platforms. Traditionally, the design and implementation of
control systems are often separated, which causes the development of embedded
control systems to be highly time-consuming and costly. To address these
problems, this paper presents a low-cost, reusable, reconfigurable platform
that enables integrated design and implementation of embedded control systems.
To minimize the cost, free and open source software packages such as Linux and
Scilab are used. Scilab is ported to the embedded ARM-Linux system. The drivers
for interfacing Scilab with several communication protocols including serial,
Ethernet, and Modbus are developed. Experiments are conducted to test the
developed embedded platform. The use of Scilab enables implementation of
complex control algorithms on embedded platforms. With the developed platform,
it is possible to perform all phases of the development cycle of embedded
control systems in a unified environment, thus facilitating the reduction of
development time and cost.
