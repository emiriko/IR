Results from recent analyses of the NA48 experiment at CERN are compared with
other experiments and confronted with theoretical predictions to provide
constraints on the CKM matrix and on CP Violation.
  The observable eta+- is related to the parameters of indirect and direct CPV
(eta+- = epsilon + epsilon'). |eta+-| has been determined by measuring the
ratio of decay rates:
  Gamma(K_L to pi+pi-)/Gamma(K_L to pi e nu), using an NA48 run with a
dedicated pure high-intensity K_L beam.
  The main objective of NA48/2 has been to search for direct CP violation by
high precision measurement of the asymmetry A_g = (g+ - g-)/(g+ + g-) of the
linear slope parameter g in the Dalitz plot of K+- to 3pi decays. The final
results from all data samples are summarised and discussed.
  The decay rates R(Ke3/K2pi), R(Kmu3/K2pi) and R(Kmu3/Ke3) have been measured
with charged K decays from special data samples with a low bias trigger in the
NA48/2 experiment. Using the latest PDG average for the (K+- to pi+- pi0)
normalisation channel, the Ke3 and Kmu3 branching fractions are then used as
input to deduce the CKM matrix element Vus.
