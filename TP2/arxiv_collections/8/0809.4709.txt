The time-dependent Dirac equation was solved for zero-impact-parameter bare
U-U collisions in the monopole approximation using a mapped Fourier grid matrix
representation. A total of 2048 states including bound, as well as positive-
and negative-energy states for an N=1024 spatial grid were propagated to
generate occupation amplitudes as a function of internuclear separation. From
these amplitudes spectra were calculated for total inclusive positron and
electron production, and also the correlated spectra for ($e^+,e^-$) pair
production. These were analyzed as a function of nuclear sticking time in order
to establish signatures of spontaneous pair creation, i.e., QED vacuum decay.
Subcritical Fr-Fr and highly supercritical Db-Db collisions both at the Coulomb
barrier were also studied and contrasted with the U-U results.
