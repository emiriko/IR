Rotational states for trapped bosons in an optical lattice are studied in the
framework of the Hubbard model. Critical frequencies are calculated and the
main parameter regimes are identified. Transitions are observed from edge
superfluids to vortex lattices with Mott insulating cores, and subsequently to
lattices of interstitial vortices. The former transition coincides with the
Mott transition. Changes in symmetry of the vortex lattices are observed as a
function of lattice depth. Predictions for experimental signatures are
presented.
