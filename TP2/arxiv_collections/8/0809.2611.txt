We consider a small metallic particle (quantum dot) where ferromagnetism
arises as a consequence of Stoner instability. When the particle is connected
to electrodes, exchange of electrons between the particle and the electrodes
leads to a temperature- and bias-driven Brownian motion of the direction of the
particle magnetization. Under certain conditions this Brownian motion is
described by the stochastic Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation. As an example of
its application, we calculate the frequency-dependent magnetic susceptibility
of the particle in a constant external magnetic field, which is relevant for
ferromagnetic resonance measurements.
