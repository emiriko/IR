Surface soliton formation and lattice soliton dynamics at an interface
between two inhomogeneous periodic media are studied in terms of an effective
particle approach. The global reflection, transmission and trapping
characteristics are obtained in direct analogy to linear Snell's laws for
homogeneous media. Interesting dynamics related to soliton power-dependent
formation of potential barriers and wells suggest spatial filtering
functionality of the respective structures.
