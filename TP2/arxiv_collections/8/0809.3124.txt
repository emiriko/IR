We discuss a Little Higgs scenario that introduces below the TeV scale just
the two minimal ingredients of these models, a vectorlike T quark and a singlet
component (implying anomalous couplings) in the Higgs field, together with a
pseudoscalar singlet \eta. In the model, which is a variation of Schmaltz's
simplest Little Higgs model, all the extra vector bosons are much heavier than
the T quark. In the Yukawa sector the global symmetry is approximate, implying
a single large coupling per flavour, whereas in the scalar sector it is only
broken at the loop level. We obtain the one-loop effective potential and show
that it provides acceptable masses for the Higgs h and for the singlet \eta
with no need for an extra \mu term. We find that m_\eta can be larger than
m_h/2, which would forbid the (otherwise dominant) decay mode h -> \eta\eta.
