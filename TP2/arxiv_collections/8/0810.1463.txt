Theoretical results for a single electron in multi-level system given by a
lens-shape self-assembled quantum dot in the presence of an intense harmonic
electric field are presented. A non-perturbative Floquet approach is used to
study the dynamical localization of the particle when going beyond the
two-level approach by introducing the full spectral level structure. It is
discussed the role of the different quasi-energy sidebands as the parameters of
the system change. It is found that the contribution of different drive
harmonics is controlled by fine tuning of field intensity. It is also shown
that avoided crossings in the quasi-energy spectrum are correlated with the
spectral force of the sidebands and dynamical state localization.
