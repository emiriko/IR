We study an experimental scheme to generate Gaussian two-mode entangled
states via beam splitter. Specifically, we consider a nonclassical Gaussian
state (squeezed state) and a thermal state as two input modes, and evaluate the
degree of entanglement at the output. Experimental conditions to generate
entangled outputs are completely identified and the critical thermal noise to
destroy entanglement is analytically obtained. By doing so, we discuss the
possibility to link the resistance to noise in entanglement generation with the
degree of single-mode nonclassicality.
