Electrical resistivity measurements under high pressures up to 29 GPa were
performed for oxypnictide compound LaFeAsO. We found a pressure-induced
superconductivity in LaFeAsO. The maximum value of Tc is 21 K at ~12 GPa. The
pressure dependence of the Tc is similar to those of LaFeAsO1-xFx series
reported previously.
