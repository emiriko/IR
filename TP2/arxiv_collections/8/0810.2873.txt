We present an update of the results for pion mass and pion decay constant as
obtained by the ETM collaboration in large scale simulations with maximally
twisted mass fermions and two mass degenerate flavours of light quarks. We
discuss the continuum, chiral and infinite volume extrapolation of these
quantities as well as the extraction of low energy constants, and investigate
possible systematic uncertainties.
