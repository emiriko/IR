The fully enriched &mu;-calculus is the extension of the propositional
&mu;-calculus with inverse programs, graded modalities, and nominals. While
satisfiability in several expressive fragments of the fully enriched
&mu;-calculus is known to be decidable and ExpTime-complete, it has recently
been proved that the full calculus is undecidable. In this paper, we study the
fragments of the fully enriched &mu;-calculus that are obtained by dropping at
least one of the additional constructs. We show that, in all fragments obtained
in this way, satisfiability is decidable and ExpTime-complete. Thus, we
identify a family of decidable logics that are maximal (and incomparable) in
expressive power. Our results are obtained by introducing two new automata
models, showing that their emptiness problems are ExpTime-complete, and then
reducing satisfiability in the relevant logics to these problems. The automata
models we introduce are two-way graded alternating parity automata over
infinite trees (2GAPTs) and fully enriched automata (FEAs) over infinite
forests. The former are a common generalization of two incomparable automata
models from the literature. The latter extend alternating automata in a similar
way as the fully enriched &mu;-calculus extends the standard &mu;-calculus.
