We investigate the ground-state properties of the one-dimensional two-band
Hubbard model with different bandwidths. The density-matrix renormalization
group method is applied to calculate the averaged electron occupancies $n$ as a
function of the chemical potential $\mu$. Both at quarter and half fillings,
"charge plateaux" appear in the $n$-$\mu$ plot, where $d\mu/dn$ diverges and
the Mott insulating states are realized. To see how the orbital polarization in
the one-quarter charge plateau develops, we apply the second-order perturbation
theory from the strong-coupling limit at quarter filling. The resultant
Kugel-Khomskii spin-orbital model includes a $magnetic$ field coupled to
orbital pseudo-spins. This field originates from the discrepancy between the
two bandwidths and leads to a finite orbital pseudo-spin magnetization.
