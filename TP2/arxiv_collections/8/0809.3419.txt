The dominance of chi_0 in the data for e+e- to psi + chi_J(c\bar{c}) is shown
to violate OZI factorization. Single gluon exchange gives a non-factorizing
effective S.L interaction that generates a large scalar production amplitude.
This also has observable effects near threshold in e+e- to D*D_J, where
enhancements of D*D_0 and DD_1 channels are predicted. Further tests and
implications are discussed.
