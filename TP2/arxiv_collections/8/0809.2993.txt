We describe a method to engineer giant nonlinearities in, and probes to
measure nonlinear observables of, mesoscopic quantum resonators. This involves
tailoring the Hamiltonian of a simple auxiliary system perturbatively coupled
to the resonator, and has the potential to engineer a wide range of
nonlinearities to high accuracy. We give a number of explicit examples,
including a readily realizable two-qubit auxiliary system that creates an x^4
potential and a Chi^(3) (Kerr) nonlinearity, valid to fifth-order in the
perturbative coupling.
