The braneworlds models were inspired partly by Kaluza-Klein's theory, where
both the gravitational and the gauge fields are obtained from the geometry of a
higher dimensional space. The positive aspects of these models consist in
perspectives of modifications it could bring in to particle physics, such as:
unification in a TeV scale, quantum gravity in this scale and deviation of
Newton's law for small distances. One of the principles of these models is to
suppose that all space-times can be embedded in a bulk of higher dimension. The
main result in these notes is a theorem showing a mathematical inconsistency of
the Randall-Sundrum braneworld model, namely that the Schwarzschild space-time
cannot be embedded locally and isometrically in a five dimensional bulk with
constant curvature,(for example AdS-5). From the point of view of
semi-Riemannian geometry this last result represents a serious restriction to
the Randall-Sundrum's braneworld model.
