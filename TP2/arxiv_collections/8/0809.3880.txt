This article reviews the current status of experimental results obtained in
the measurement of light vector mesons produced in proton-proton and heavy ion
collisions at different energies. The review is focused on two phenomena
related to the light vector mesons; the modification of the spectral shape in
search of Chiral symmetry restoration and suppression of the meson production
in heavy ion collisions. The experimental results show that the spectral shape
of light vector mesons are modified compared to the parameters measured in
vacuum. The nature and the magnitude of the modification depends on the energy
density of the media in which they are produced. The suppression patterns of
light vector mesons are different from the measurements of other mesons and
baryons. The mechanisms responsible for the suppression of the mesons are not
yet understood. Systematic comparison of existing experimental results points
to the missing data which may help to resolve the problem.
