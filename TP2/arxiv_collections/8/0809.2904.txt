I review arguments demonstrating how the concept of "particle" numbers arises
in the form of equidistant energy eigenvalues of coupled harmonic oscillators
representing free fields. Their quantum numbers (numbers of nodes of the wave
functions) can be interpreted as occupation numbers for objects with a formal
mass (defined by the field equation) and spatial wave number ("momentum")
characterizing classical field modes. A superposition of different oscillator
eigenstates, all consisting of n modes having one node, while all others have
none, defines a nondegenerate "n-particle wave function". Other discrete
properties and phenomena (such as particle positions and "events") can be
understood by means of the fast but smooth process of decoherence: the
irreversible dislocalization of superpositions. Any wave-particle dualism thus
becomes obsolete. The observation of individual outcomes of this decoherence
process in measurements requires either a subsequent collapse of the wave
function or a "branching observer" in accordance with the Schr\"odinger
equation - both possibilities applying clearly after the decoherence process.
Any probability interpretation of the wave function in terms of local elements
of reality, such as particles or other classical concepts, would open a
Pandora's box of paradoxes, as is illustrated by various misnomers that have
become popular in quantum theory.
