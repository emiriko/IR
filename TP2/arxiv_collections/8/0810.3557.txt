In this paper, we explicitly construct (Abelian) anyonic excitations of
arbitrary stabilizer Hamiltonians which are local on a 2D lattice of qubits.
This leads directly to the conclusion that, in the presence of local thermal
noise, such systems cannot be used for the fault-tolerant storage of quantum
information by self-correction i.e. they are ruled out as candidates for a
`quantum hard drive'. We suggest that in 3D, the same construction leads to an
argument that self-correction is impossible.
