In this paper we introduce three notions of measure theoretical entropy of a
measurable cover U in a measure theoretical dynamical system. Two of them were
already introduced in [R] and the new one is defined only in the ergodic case.
We then prove that these three notions coincide, thus answering a question
posed in [R] and recover a variational inequality (proved in [GW]) and a proof
of the classical variational principle based on a comparison between the
entropies of covers and partitions.
