We review the first decade of extensive optical studies of ferromagnetic,
III-Mn-V diluted magnetic semiconductors. Mn introduces holes and local moments
to the III-V host, which can result in carrier mediated ferromagnetism in these
disordered semiconductors. Spectroscopic experiments provide direct access to
the strength and nature of the exchange between holes and local moments; the
degree of itineracy of the carriers; and the evolution of the states at the
Fermi energy with doping. Taken together, diversity of optical methods reveal
that Mn is an unconventional dopant, in that the metal to insulator transition
is governed by the strength of the hybridization between Mn and its p-nictogen
neighbor. The interplay between the optical, electronic and magnetic properties
of III-Mn-V magnetic semiconductors is of fundamental interest and may enable
future spin-optoelectronic devices.
