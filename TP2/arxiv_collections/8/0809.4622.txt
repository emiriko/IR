Popular computational models of visual attention tend to neglect the
influence of saccadic eye movements whereas it has been shown that the primates
perform on average three of them per seconds and that the neural substrate for
the deployment of attention and the execution of an eye movement might
considerably overlap. Here we propose a computational model in which the
deployment of attention with or without a subsequent eye movement emerges from
local, distributed and numerical computations.
