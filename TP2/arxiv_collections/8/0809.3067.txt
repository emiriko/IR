A novel doubly chiral magnetic order is found out in the structurally chiral
langasite compound Ba$_3$NbFe$_3$Si$_2$O$_{14}$. The magnetic moments are
distributed over planar frustrated triangular lattices of triangle units. On
each of these they form the same triangular configuration. This ferro-chiral
arrangement is helically modulated from plane to plane. Unpolarized neutron
scattering on a single crystal associated with spherical neutron polarimetry
proved that a single triangular chirality together with a single helicity is
stabilized in an enantiopure crystal. A mean field analysis allows discerning
the relevance on this selection of a twist in the plane to plane
supersuperexchange paths.
