We report the results of a project to control the use of end user computing
tools for business critical applications in a banking environment. Several
workstreams were employed in order to bring about a cultural change within the
bank towards the use of spreadsheets and other end-user tools, covering policy
development, awareness and skills training, inventory monitoring, user
licensing, key risk metrics and mitigation approaches. The outcomes of these
activities are discussed, and conclusions are drawn as to the need for
appropriate organisational models to guide the use of these tools.
