We study theoretically the dispersion of plasmonic honeycomb lattices and
find Dirac spectra for both dipole and quadrupole modes. Zigzag edge states
derived from Dirac points are found in ribbons of these honeycomb plasmonic
lattices. The zigzag edge states for out-of-plane dipole modes are closely
analogous to the electronic ones in graphene nanoribbons. The edge states for
in-plane dipole modes and quadrupole modes, however, have rather unique
characters due to the vector nature of the plasmonic excitations. The
conditions for the existence of plasmonic edge states are derived analytically.
