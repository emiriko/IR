A raga is a melodic structure with fixed notes and a set of rules
characterizing a certain mood endorsed through performance. By a vadi swar is
meant that note which plays the most significant role in expressing the raga. A
samvadi swar similarly is the second most significant note. However, the
determination of their significance has an element of subjectivity and hence we
are motivated to find some truths through an objective analysis. The paper
proposes a probabilistic method of note detection and demonstrates how the
relative frequency (relative number of occurrences of the pitch) of the more
important notes stabilize far more quickly than that of others. In addition, a
count for distinct transitory and similar looking non-transitory (fundamental)
frequency movements (but possibly embedding distinct emotions!) between the
notes is also taken depicting the varnalankars or musical ornaments decorating
the notes and note sequences as rendered by the artist. They reflect certain
structural properties of the ragas. Several case studies are presented.
