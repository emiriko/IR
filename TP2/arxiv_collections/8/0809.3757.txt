We present a measurement of the electron-capture branch of $^{100}$Tc. Our
value, $B(\text{EC}) = (2.6 \pm 0.4) \times 10^{-5}$, implies that the
$^{100}$Mo neutrino absorption cross section to the ground state of $^{100}$Tc
is roughly one third larger than previously thought. Compared to previous
measurements, our value of $B(\text{EC})$ prevents a smaller disagreement with
QRPA calculations relevant to double-$\beta$ decay matrix elements.
