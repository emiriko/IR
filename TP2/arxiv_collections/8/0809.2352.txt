Motivated by Shokurov's ACC Conjecture for log canonical thresholds, we
propose an inductive point of view on singularities of pairs, in the case when
the ambient variety is smooth. Our main result characterizes the log canonicity
of a pair in dimension N+1 by the log canonicity of another pair (not
effective, in general) in dimension N.
