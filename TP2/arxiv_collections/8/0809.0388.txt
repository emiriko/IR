Recent experimental results obtained using $\beta$ decay and isomer
spectroscopy indicate an unusual behaviour of the energies of the first excited
2$^{+}$ states in neutron-rich Cd isotopes approaching the N=82 shell closure.
To explain the unexpected trend, changes of the nuclear structure far-off
stability have been suggested, namely a quenching of the N=82 shell gap already
in $^{130}$Cd, only two proton holes away from doubly magic $^{132}$Sn. We
study the behaviour of the 2$^+$ energies in the Cd isotopes from N=50 to N=82,
i.e. across the entire span of a major neutron shell using modern beyond mean
field techniques and the Gogny force. We demonstrate that the observed low
2$^+$ excitation energy in $^{128}$Cd close to the N=82 shell closure is a
consequence of the doubly magic character of this nucleus for oblate
deformation favoring thereby prolate configurations rather than spherical ones.
