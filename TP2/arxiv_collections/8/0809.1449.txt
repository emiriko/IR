The thermodynamics of a scalar field with a quartic interaction is studied
within the linear delta expansion (LDE) method. Using the imaginary-time
formalism the free energy is evaluated up to second order in the LDE. The
method generates nonperturbative results that are then used to obtain
thermodynamic quantities like the pressure. The phase transition pattern of the
model is fully studied, from the broken to the symmetry restored phase. The
results are compared with those obtained with other nonperturbative methods and
also with ordinary perturbation theory. The results coming from the two main
optimization procedures used in conjunction with the LDE method, the Principle
of Minimal Sensitivity (PMS) and the Fastest Apparent Convergence (FAC) are
also compared with each other and studied in which cases they are applicable or
not. The optimization procedures are applied directly to the free energy.
