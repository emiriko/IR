We demonstrate that in the region of Bjorken x ~m_\pi^2/(4\pi F_\pi)^2 and/or
x ~|t|/(4\pi F_\pi)^2 the standard ChPT for the pion GPDs fails and one must
perform all order resummation of ChPT. We perform such resummation in the
large-N limit of the O(N+1) extension of the chiral theory. Explicit
resummation allows us to reveal novel phenomena -- the form of the leading
chiral correction to pion PDFs and GPDs depends on the small-x asymptotic of
the pion PDFs. In particular, if the pion PDF in the chiral limit has the
Regge-like small x behaviour q(x)~1/x^\omega, the leading large impact
parameter ($b_\perp\to\infty$) asymptotics of the quark distribution in the
transverse plane has the form ($m_\pi=0$) $q(x,b_\perp)\sim 1/x^\omega\
\ln^{\omega}(b_\perp^2)/b_\perp^{2{(1+\omega)}}$. This result is model
independent and it is controlled completely by the all order resummed ChPT
developed in this paper. This asymptotic interweaves with small-$x$ behaviour
of usual PDFs, hence it depends on the scale, at which the corresponding PDF is
defined. This is a new and interesting result in which the chiral expansion
meets the QCD evolution.
