An increased precision of HERA data allows studies of exclusive processes in
their transition from soft to hard interactions as well as in the pQCD domain.
The recent measurements of vector meson production and Deeply Virtual Compton
Scattering (DVCS) performed by the H1 and ZEUS experiments are reported and
compared to pQCD expectations.
