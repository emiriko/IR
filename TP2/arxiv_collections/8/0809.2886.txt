Recent results on CP parameters of the B systems obtained by the CDF and D0
collaborations using the data samples collected at the Tevatron Collider in the
period 2002 - 2007 were presented at the QCD 2008 conference (Montpellier,
France). These results include measurements of the mixing phase, decay width
difference, and CP violation parameters in the Bs and Bu decays.
