We apply the Effective Field Theory approach to General Relativity,
introduced by Goldberger and Rothstein, to study point-like and string-like
sources in the context of scalar-tensor theories of gravity. Within this
framework we compute the classical energy-momentum tensor renormalization to
first Post-Newtonian order or, in the case of extra scalar fields, up to first
order in the (non-derivative) trilinear interaction terms: this allows to write
down the corrections to the standard (Newtonian) gravitational potential and to
the extra-scalar potential. In the case of one-dimensional extended sources we
give an alternative derivation of the renormalization of the string tension
enabling a re-analysis of the discrepancy between the results obtained by
Dabholkar and Harvey in one paper and by Buonanno and Damour in another,
already discussed in the latter.
