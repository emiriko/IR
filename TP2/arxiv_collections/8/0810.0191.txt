This paper proposes an abstract theory concerned with dynamical systems
generated by doubly nonlinear evolution equations governed by subdifferential
operators with non-monotone perturbations in a reflexive Banach space setting.
In order to construct global attractors, an approach based on the notion of
generalized semiflow is employed instead of the usual semi-group approach,
since solutions of the Cauchy problem for the equation might not be unique.
Moreover, the preceding abstract theory is applied to a generalized Allen-Cahn
equation whose potential is divided into a convex part and a non-convex part as
well as a semilinear parabolic equation with a nonlinear term involving
gradients.
