General Relativity on closed spatial topologies can be derived, using a
technique called "best-matching", as an evolving 3-geometry subject to
constraints. These constraints can be thought of as a way of imposing temporal
and spatial relationalism. The same type of constraints can be used in
non-relativistic particle models to produce relational theories that suffer
from the same Problem of Time as that encountered in General Relativity. As a
result, these simple toy models are well suited for studying the Problem of
Time in quantum gravity. In this paper, a version of these particle models is
studied where we "best-match" the time translational invariance of the theory.
Using insights gained from this procedure, we can move back and forth between
absolute and relational time by changing the way in which the relational fields
are varied. We then proceed to quantize this theory using Dirac and path
integral quantizations. We discover that one of the constraints of the theory,
which we call the Mach constraint, is responsible for removing the dependence
of the theory on a background structure. It is this Mach constraint that is
responsible for making the theory temporally relational. Because of the deep
relationship between these models and General Relativity, this work may shed
new light on the Problem of Time in quantum gravity and how one might expect
time to emerge on quantum subsystems of the universe.
