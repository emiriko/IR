The cross sections of the astrophysically relevant 85$Rb(p,n)85Srg,m reaction
have been measured between Ec.m. = 2.16 and 3.96 MeV. The cross sections have
been derived by measuring the gamma radiation following the beta decay of the
reaction products. A comparison with the predictions of Hauser-Feshbach
calculations using the NON-SMOKER code confirms a recently derived modification
of the global optical proton potential.
