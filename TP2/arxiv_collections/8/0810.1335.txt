The paper studies semi-almost periodic holomorphic functions on a polydisk
which have, in a sense, the weakest possible discontinuities on the boundary
torus. The basic result used in the proofs is an extension of the classical
Bohr approximation theorem for almost periodic holomorphic functions on a strip
to the case of Banach-valued almost periodic holomorphic functions.
