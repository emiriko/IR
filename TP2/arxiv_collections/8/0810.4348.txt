The bifurcation diagram of a model nonlinear Langevin equation with delayed
feedback is obtained numerically. We observe both direct and oscillatory
bifurcations in different ranges of model parameters. Below threshold, the
stationary distribution function p(x) is a delta function at the trivial state
x=0. Above threshold, p(x) ~ x^alpha at small x, with alpha = -1 at threshold,
and monotonously increasing with the value of the control parameter above
threshold. Unlike the case without delayed feedback, the bifurcation threshold
is shifted by fluctuations by an amount that scales linearly with the noise
intensity. With numerical information about time delayed correlations, we
derive an analytic expression for p(x) which is in good agreement with the
numerical results.
