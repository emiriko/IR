We inspect consequences of the latest B_s mixing phase measurements on lepton
flavor violation in a supersymmetric SU(5) theory. The O(1) phase, preferring a
non-vanishing squark mixing, generically implies tau -> (e + mu) gamma and mu
-> e gamma. Depending on the gaugino and the scalar mass parameters as well as
tan beta, the rates turn out to be detectable or even already excessive, if the
RR mass insertion of down-type squarks is nonzero. We find that it becomes easy
to reconcile B_s mixing phase with lepton flavor violation given: gaugino to
scalar squared mass ratio around 1/12, both LL and RR insertions with decent
sizes, and low tan beta.
