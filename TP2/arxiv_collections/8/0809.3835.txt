We prove scattering for the radial nonlinear Klein-Gordon equation $
\partial_{tt} u - \Delta u + u = -|u|^{p-1} u $ with $5 > p >3$ and data $
(u_{0}, u_{1}) \in H^{s} \times H^{s-1} $, $ 1 > s > 1-
\frac{(5-p)(p-3)}{2(p-1)(p-2)} $ if $ 4 \geq p > 3 $ and $ 1 > s > 1 -
\frac{(5-p)^{2}}{2(p-1)(6-p)}$ if $ 5> p \geq 4$. First we prove
Strichartz-type estimates in $ L_{t}^{q} L_{x}^{r} $ spaces. Then by using
these decays we establish some local bounds. By combining these results with a
Morawetz-type estimate and a radial Sobolev inequality we control the variation
of an almost conserved quantity on arbitrarily large intervals. Once we have
showed that this quantity is controlled, we prove that some of these local
bounds can be upgraded to global bounds. This is enough to establish
scattering. All the estimates involved require a delicate analysis due to the
nature of the nonlinearity and the lack of scaling.
