The analytic result for the $S$-matrix in the saturation regime including the
running coupling is obtained. To get this result we solve the Balitsky and
Kovchegov-Weigert evolution equations in the saturation regime, which include
running coupling corrections. We study also the effect of rare fluctuations on
top of the running coupling. We find that the rare fluctuations are less
important in the running coupling case as compared to the fixed coupling case.
