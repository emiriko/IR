We point out that in some situations it is possible to use matrix model
techniques a la Dijkgraaf-Vafa to perturbatively compute D-brane instanton
effects. This provides an explanation in terms of stringy instantons of the
results in hep-th/0311181. We check this proposal in some simple scenarios. We
point out some interesting consequences of this observation, such as the fact
that it gives a perturbative way of computing stringy multi-instanton effects.
It also provides a further interpretation of D-brane instantons as residual
instantons of higgsed supergroups.
