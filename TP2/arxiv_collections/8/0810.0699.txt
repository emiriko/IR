We performed high-field magnetotransport and magnetization measurements on a
single crystal of the 122-phase iron pnictide Ba(Fe1-xCox)2As2. Unlike the HTS
cuprates and 1111-phase oxypnictides, Ba(Fe1-xCox)2As2 showed practically no
broadening of the resistive transitions under magnetic fields up to 45 T. The
mass anisotropy gamma = Hc2ab/Hc2c deduced from the slopes of the upper
critical field dHc2ab/dT = 4.9T/K and dHc2c/dT = 2.5T/K decreases from ~2 near
Tc, to ~1.5 at lower temperatures. We observed the irreversibility field close
to Hc2, and a rather unusual symmetric volume pinning force curve Fp(H)
suggestive of strong pinning nano-structure.
