The main fundamental principles characterizing the vacuum field structure are
formulated and the modeling of the related vacuum medium and charged point
particle dynamics by means of devised field theoretic tools are analyzed. The
work is devoted to studying the vacuum structure, special relativity,
electrodynamics of interacting charged point particles and quantum mechanics,
and is a continuation of \cite{BPT,BRT1}. Based on the vacuum field theory
no-geometry approach, the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian reformulation of some
alternative classical electrodynamics models is devised. The Dirac type
quantization procedure, based on the canonical Hamiltonian formulation, is
developed for some alternative electrodynamics models. Within an approach
developed a possibility of the combined description both of electrodynamics and
gravity is analyzed.
