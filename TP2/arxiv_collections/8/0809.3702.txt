We establish the strong L2(P)-convergence of properly rescaled Wick powers as
the power index tends to infinity. The explicit representation of such limit
will also provide the convergence in distribution to normal and log-normal
random variables. The proofs rely on some estimates for the L2(P)-norm of Wick
products and on the properties of second quantization operators.
