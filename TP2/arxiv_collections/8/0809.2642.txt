The Kolmogorov complexity of a string is the length of its shortest
description. We define a second quantised Kolmogorov complexity where the
length of a description is defined to be the average length of its
superposition. We discuss this complexity's basic properties. We define the
corresponding prefix complexity and show that the inequalities obeyed by this
prefix complexity are also obeyed by von Neumann entropy.
