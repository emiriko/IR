Quantum oscillations in graphene is discussed. The effect of interactions are
addressed by Kohn's theorem regarding de Haas-van Alphen oscillations, which
states that electron-electron interactions cannot affect the oscillation
frequencies as long as disorder is neglected and the system is sufficiently
screened, which should be valid for chemical potentials not very close to the
Dirac point. We determine the positions of Landau levels in the presence of
potential disorder from exact transfer matrix and finite size diagonalization
calculations. The positions are shown to be unshifted even for moderate
disorder; stronger disorder, can, however, lead to shifts, but this also
appears minimal even for disorder width as large as one-half of the bare
hopping matrix element on the graphene lattice. Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations
of the conductivity are calculated analytically within a self-consistent Born
approximation of impurity scattering. The oscillatory part of the conductivity
follows the widely invoked Lifshitz-Kosevich form when certain mass and
frequency parameters are properly interpreted.
