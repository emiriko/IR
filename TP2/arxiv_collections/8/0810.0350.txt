Hole carrier doping has been tried to pseudo-low-dimensional material La2RuO5
by substituting La3+ with Cd2+. Single phased samples of La2-xCdxRuO5 with x up
to 0.5 have been successfully obtained and also high pressure O2 annealing has
been performed to the x=0.5 sample. Although the formal ionic state of Ru is
expected to increase from 4+ (at x=0) to 4.5+ (at x=0.5), the magnetic and
electrical properties show no significant changes in as-sintered samples. In
contrast, high pressure O2 annealed x=0.5 samples show a little reduction of
electrical resistivity and the decrease of thermoelectric power at 260 K. From
these results, it can be speculated that the doped carriers are mostly
compensated by oxygen deficiency in as-sintered samples.
