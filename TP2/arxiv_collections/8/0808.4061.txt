We demonstrate a method for precision spectroscopy on trapped ions in the
limit of unresolved motional sidebands. By sympathetic cooling of a chain of
crystallized ions we suppress adverse temperature variations induced by the
spectroscopy laser that usually lead to a distorted line profle and obtain a
Voigt profile with negligible distortions. We applied the method to measure the
absolute frequency of the astrophysically relevant D2 transition in single
24-Mg+ ions and find 1072082934.33(16)MHz, a nearly 400fold improvement over
previous results. Further, we find the excited state lifetime to be 3.84(10)
ns.
