The N=2 supersymmetric KdV equations are studied within the framework of
Hirota's bilinear method. For two such equations, namely $N=2, a=4$ and $N=2,
a=1$ supersymmetric KdV equations, we obtain the corresponding bilinear
formulations. Using them, we construct particular solutions for both cases. In
particular, a bilinear B\"{a}cklund transformation is given for the $N=2, a=1$
supersymmetric KdV equation.
