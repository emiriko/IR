LDA+DMFT (Local Density Approximation combined with Dynamical Mean-Field
Theory) computation scheme has been used to calculate spectral properties of
LaFeAsO -- the parent compound for new high-T$_c$ iron oxypnictides. Coulomb
repulsion $U$ and Hund's exchange $J$ parameters for iron 3d electrons were
calculated using \textit {first principles} constrained density functional
theory scheme in Wannier functions formalism. Resulting values strongly depend
on the number of states taken into account in calculations: when full set of
O-$2p$, As-$4p$, and Fe-3d orbitals with corresponding bands are included,
computation results in $U=3\div$4 eV and J=0.8 eV. In contrast to that when the
basis set is restricted to Fe-3d orbitals and bands only, computation gives
much smaller parameter values $F^0$=0.8 eV, $J$=0.5 eV. However, DMFT
calculations with both parameter sets and corresponding to them choice of basis
functions result in weakly correlated electronic structure that is in agreement
with experimental X-ray and photoemission spectra.
