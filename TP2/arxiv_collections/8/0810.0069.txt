  This thesis presents a study of the cyclotomic BMW (Birman-Murakami-Wenzl)
algebras, introduced by Haring-Oldenburg as a generalization of the BMW
algebras associated with the cyclotomic Hecke algebras of type G(k,1,n) (also
known as Ariki-Koike algebras) and type B knot theory involving
affine/cylindrical tangles.
  They are shown to be free of rank k^n (2n-1)!! and to have a topological
realization as a certain cylindrical analogue of the Kauffman Tangle algebra.
  Furthermore, the cyclotomic BMW algebras are proven to be cellular, in the
sense of Graham and Lehrer.
  This Ph.D. thesis, completed at the University of Sydney, was submitted
September 2007 and passed December 2007.
