Many weakly interacting sub-electronVolt particles (WISPs) are easily
accommodated in extensions of the standard model. Generally the strongest
bounds on their existence come from stellar evolution and cosmology, where to
the best of our knowledge observations seem to agree with the standard budget
of particles. In this talk I review the most demanding constraints for axions
and axion-like-particles, hidden photons and mini-charged particles.
