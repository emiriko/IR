We compute the asymptotic expectation of the number of {\em open} nodal lines
for random waves on smooth planar domains. We find that for both the long
energy window $[0,\lambda]$ and the short one $[\lambda,\lambda+1]$ the
expected number of open nodal lines is proportional to $\lambda$,
asymptotically as $\lambda\to\infty$. Our results are consistent with the
predictions in the physics literature made by Blum, Gnutzmann and Smilansky
\cite{BGS}.
