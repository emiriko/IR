We study the second-moment correlation length and the reduced susceptibility
of two ferromagnetic Ising models with zero-temperature ordering. By
introducing a scaling variable motivated by high-temperature series expansions,
we are able to scale data for the one-dimensional Ising ferromagnet rigorously
over the entire temperature range. Analogous scaling expressions are then
applied to the two-dimensional fully frustrated Villain model where excellent
finite-size scaling over the entire temperature range is achieved. Thus we
broaden the applicability of the extended scaling method to Ising systems
having a zero-temperature critical point.
