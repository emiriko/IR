We find out classical particles, starting from Dirac quantum fields on a
curved space-time, by an eikonal approximation and a localization hypothesis
for amplitudes. We recover the results by Mathisson-Papapetrou, hence
establishing a fundamental correspondence between the coupling of classical and
quantum spinning particles with the gravitational field.
