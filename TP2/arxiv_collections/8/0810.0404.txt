An overview of the recent results on strangeness production and spectroscopy
from the electron-proton collider experiments H1 and ZEUS at HERA is presented.
Production of particles with light and strange quarks is discussed and compared
with both theoretical predictions and with data from e+e- experiments.
Measurements in the charm sector cover studies of the radially and orbitally
excited charm states. Finally, the investigation of exotic states in the
strangeness sector at HERA is reviewed.
