In this work, starting by simple, approximate (quasi-classical) methods
presented in our previous works, we reproduce effectively and generalize final
results of Herdeiro and Rebelo on the basic thermodynamical characteristics
(entropy and temperature) of two interacting Kerr black holes (in touching
limit) obtained recently by accurate analysis. Like as it has been done in our
previous works, we simply suppose that circumference of the horizon of total
black hole (that includes two or, generally, a "crystal lattice" of many
interacting Kerr black holes in touching limit, without angular momentum) holds
integer number of reduced Compton wave lengths corresponding to mass spectrum
of a small quantum system captured at horizon. (Obviously it is conceptually
analogous to Bohr quantization postulate interpreted by de Broglie relation in
Old, Bohr-Sommerfeld, quantum theory.) It, by simple mathematical methods,
first neighbour approximation of the black holes interaction and first
thermodynamical law, implies mentioned basic thermodinamical characteristic of
the total black hole as well as any its part, i.e. single black hole.
Especially, it is shown that, in limit of increasing number of the black holes,
entropy and horizon surface of the total black hole stand observables of the
discrete spectrum while entropy and horizon surface of the single black hole
tends toward observables of the continuous spectrum.
