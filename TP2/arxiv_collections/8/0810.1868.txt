The thermal hysteresis of the electronic transport properties were studied
for V2O3 thin films. The temporal evolution of the resistance shows the
out-of-equilibrium nature of this hysteresis with a very slow relaxation.
Partial cycles reveal not only a behavior consistent with phase coexistence,
but also the presence of spinodal temperatures which are largely separated. The
temperature spreading of phase coexistence is consistent with the bulk phase
diagram in the pressure-temperature plane, confirming that the film is
effectively under an effective pressure induced by the substrate.
