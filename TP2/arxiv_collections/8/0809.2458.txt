We have discovered a new fractal pattern, coffee exhibits on a horizontal
surface, with a fractal dimension $1.88 \pm 0.06$, when a heavy coffee droplet
interacts with the surface of lighter milk. Parts of coffee pattern on the
surface disappear due to Rayleigh-Taylor instability, and the annihilative
behavior produces the fractal pattern. Coffee fractals and the Sierpinski
carpet have common features, such as the fractal dimension, annihilative
behavior, and an exponential decrease of the pattern area. It is suggested the
formation of fractal follows a rule similar to that of the Sierpinski carpet.
