It is a fundamental consequence of the superposition principle for quantum
states that there must exist non-orthogonal states, that is states that,
although different, have a non-zero overlap. This finite overlap means that
there is no way of determining with certainty in which of two such states a
given physical system has been prepared. We review the various strategies that
have been devised to discriminate optimally between non-orthogonal states and
some of the optical experiments that have been performed to realise these.
