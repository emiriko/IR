Significant overweight represents a major health problem in industrialized
countries. Besides its known metabolic origins, this condition may also have an
infectious cause, as recently postulated. Here, it is surmised that the
potentially causative adenovirus 36 contributes to such disorder by
inactivating the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein (RB) in a manner
reminiscent of a mechanism employed by both another pathogenic adenoviral agent
and insulin. The present insight additionally suggests novel modes of
interfering with obesity-associated pathology.
