We report the progress in the measurement of the pionium lifetime by the
DIRAC Collaboration at CERN (PS212). Based on data collected in 2001-2003 on Ni
targets we have achieved the precision of 11% in the measurement of the pionium
lifetime, which corresponds to the measurement of S-wave pion-pion scattering
lengths difference |a0-a2| with the accuracy of 6%.
