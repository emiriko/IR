In this paper, we examine a variety of strategies for numerical quantum-state
estimation from data of the sort commonly measured in experiments involving
quantum state tomography. We find that, in some important circumstances, an
elaborate and time-consuming numerical optimization to obtain 'the best'
density matrix corresponding to a given data set is not necessary, and that
cruder, faster numerical techniques may well be 'good enough'.
