HERMES has measured azimuthal single-spin asymmetries of pions and charged
kaons produced in deep-inelastic scattering of electrons and positrons off a
transversely polarized hydrogen target. These asymmetries provide information
about the Collins and Sivers mechanisms, which are signals for the transverse
parton distribution function h_1^q in convolution with the Collins
fragmentation function H_1^{\perp,q}, and of the Sivers distribution function
f_{1T}^{\perp,q} with the spin-averaged fragmentation function D_q^h,
respectively. Furthermore, both the momentum and helicity distributions of the
strange quark sea have been extracted in leading order from the multiplicity
and the inclusive double spin asymmetry, respectively, in the production of
charged kaons when scattering polarized positrons off a longitudinally
polarized deuterium target. The shape of the momentum distribution is softer
than that of the average of the \bar{u} and \bar{d} quarks. The helicity
distribution is found to be consistent with zero.
