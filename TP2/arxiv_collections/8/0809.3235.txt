We revisit the problem of the quarter-filled one-dimensional Kondo lattice
model, for which the existence of a dimerized phase and a non-zero charge gap
had been reported in Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{90}, 247204 (2003). Recently,
some objections were raised claiming that the system is neither dimerized nor
has a charge gap. In the interest of clarifying this important issue, we show
that these objections are based on results obtained under conditions in which
the dimer order is artificially suppressed. We use the incontrovertible
dimerized phase of the Majumdar-Ghosh point of the $J_{1}-J_{2}$ Heisenberg
model as a paradigm with which to illustrate this artificial suppression.
Finally, by means of extremely accurate DMRG calculations, we show that the
charge gap is indeed non-zero in the dimerized phase.
