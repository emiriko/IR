We develop the formalism for the evaluation of density-density correlators in
lattice QCD that includes techniques for the computation of the all-to-all
propagators involved. A novel technique in this context is the implementation
of the one-end trick in the meson sector. Density-density correlators provide a
gauge invariant definition for the hadron wave function and yield information
on hadron deformation. We evaluate density-density correlators using two
degenerate flavors of dynamical Wilson fermions for the pion, the rho-meson,
the nucleon and the $\Delta$. Using the one-end trick we obtain results that
clearly show deformation of the rho-meson.
