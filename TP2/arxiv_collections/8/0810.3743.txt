Recent results at STAR for direct $\gamma$-charged hadron azimuthal
correlations in heavy-ion collisions are presented. These correlations are used
to study the color charge density of the medium through the medium-induced
modification of high-p$_T$ parton fragmentation. Azimuthal correlations of
direct photons at high transverse energy 8 $<$ E$_T$ $<$ 16 GeV with away-side
charged hadrons of transverse momentum 3 $<$ p$_T$ $<$ 6 GeV/c have been
measured over a broad range of centrality for $Au+Au$ collisions and $p+p$
collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV in the STAR experiment. The per-trigger
away-side yield of direct $\gamma$ is smaller than from $\pi^{0}$ triggers in
the same centrality class.
