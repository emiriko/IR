We consider the homogenization of parabolic equations with large
spatially-dependent potentials modeled as Gaussian random fields. We derive the
homogenized equations in the limit of vanishing correlation length of the
random potential. We characterize the leading effect in the random fluctuations
and show that their spatial moments converge in law to Gaussian random
variables. Both results hold for sufficiently small times and in sufficiently
large spatial dimensions $d\geq\m$, where $\m$ is the order of the spatial
pseudo-differential operator in the parabolic equation. In dimension $d<\m$,
the solution to the parabolic equation is shown to converge to the
(non-deterministic) solution of a stochastic equation in the companion paper
[2]. The results are then extended to cover the case of long range random
potentials, which generate larger, but still asymptotically Gaussian, random
fluctuations.
