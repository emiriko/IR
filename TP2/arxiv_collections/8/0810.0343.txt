We report a novel critical exponent delta=3/2 of magnetization curves
M=H^{1/delta} near the ferromagnetic quantum phase transitions of Sr1-xAxRuO3
(A = Ca, La0.5Na0.5, and La), which the mean field theory of the
Ginzburg-Landau-Wilson type fails to reproduce. The effect of dirty
ferromagnetic spin fluctuations might be a key.
