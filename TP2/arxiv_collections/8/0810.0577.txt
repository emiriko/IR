We present a theory of spin and orbital physics in the A-site spinel compound
FeSc2S4, which experimentally exhibits a broad "spin-orbital liquid" regime. A
spin-orbital Hamiltonian is derived from a combination of microscopic
consideration and symmetry analysis. We demonstrate a keen competition between
spin-orbit interactions, which favor formation of a local "Spin-Orbital
Singlet" (SOS), and exchange, which favors magnetic and orbital ordering.
Separating the SOS from the ordered state is a quantum critical point (QCP). We
argue that FeSc2S4 is close to this QCP on the SOS side. The full phase diagram
of the model includes a commensurate-incommensurate transition within the
ordered phase. A variety of comparison to and suggestion for experiments are
discussed.
