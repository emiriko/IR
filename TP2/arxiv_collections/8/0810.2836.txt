Graphene has many unique properties that make it an ideal material for
fundamental studies as well as for potential applications. Here we review the
recent results on the Raman spectroscopy and imaging of graphene. Raman
spectroscopy and imaging can be used as a quick and unambiguous method to
determine the number of graphene layers. Following, the strong Raman signal of
single layer graphene compared to graphite is explained by an interference
enhancement model. We have also studied the effect of substrates, the top layer
deposition, the annealing process, as well as folding (stacking order) on the
physical and electronic properties of graphene. Finally, Raman spectroscopy of
epitaxial graphene grown on SiC substrate is presented and strong compressive
strain on epitaxial graphene is observed. The results presented here are
closely related to the application of graphene on nano-electronic device and
help on the better understanding of physical and electronic properties of
graphene.
