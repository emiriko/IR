This paper presents a twist to the generation of binary random sequences by
starting with decimal sequences. Rather than representing the prime reciprocal
sequence directly in base 2, we first right the prime reciprocal in base 10 and
then convert it into the binary form. The autocorrelation and cross-correlation
properties of these binary random (BRD) sequences are discussed.
