The nonet symmetry scheme seems to describe rather well the masses and
$\eta-\eta^{\prime}$ mixing angle of the ground state pseudo-scalar mesons and
is thus expected to be also a good approximation for the matrix elements of the
pseudo-scalar density operators which play an important role in charmless
two-body B decays with $\eta$ or $\eta^{\prime}$ in the final state. In this
talk, I would like to report on a recent work on the $B^{-}\to K^{-}\eta,
K^{-}\eta^{\prime}$ decay using nonet symmetry for the matrix elements of
pseudo-scalar density operators. We find that the branching ratio $B\to PP$,
with an $\eta$ meson in the final state agrees well with data, while those with
an $\eta^{\prime}$ meson are underestimated by $20-30%$. This could be
considered as a more or less successful prediction for QCDF, considering the
theoretical uncertainties involved. This could also indicate that an additional
power-suppressed terms could bring the branching ratio close to experiment, as
with the $B\to K^{*}\pi$ and $B\to K^{*}\eta$ decay for which the measured
branching ratios are much bigger than the QCDF predictions.
