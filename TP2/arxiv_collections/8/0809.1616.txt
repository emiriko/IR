We report results from two-dimensional Raman spectroscopy studies of
large-area epitaxial graphene grown on SiC. Our work reveals unexpectedly large
variation in Raman peak position across the sample resulting from inhomogeneity
in the strain of the graphene film, which we show to be correlated with
physical topography by coupling Raman spectroscopy with atomic force
microscopy. We report that essentially strain free graphene is possible even
for epitaxial graphene.
