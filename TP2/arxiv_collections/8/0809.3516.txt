We prove, by simple manipulation of commutators, two noncommutative
generalizations of the Cauchy-Binet formula for the determinant of a product.
As special cases we obtain elementary proofs of the Capelli identity from
classical invariant theory and of Turnbull's Capelli-type identities for
symmetric and antisymmetric matrices.
