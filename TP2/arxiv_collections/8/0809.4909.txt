We provide a partial classification of positive linear maps in matrix
algebras which is based on a family of spectral conditions. This construction
generalizes celebrated Choi example of a map which is positive but not
completely positive. It is shown how the spectral conditions enable one to
construct linear maps on tensor products of matrix algebras which are positive
but only on a convex subset of separable elements. Such maps provide basic
tools to study quantum entanglement in multipartite systems.
