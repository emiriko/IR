We report the observation of an even-denominator fractional quantum Hall
(FQH) state at $\nu=1/4$ in a high quality, wide GaAs quantum well. The sample
has a quantum well width of 50 nm and an electron density of
$n_e=2.55\times10^{11}$ cm$^{-2}$. We have performed transport measurements at
$T\sim35$ mK in magnetic fields up to 45 T. When the sample is perpendicular to
the applied magnetic field, the diagonal resistance displays a kink at
$\nu=1/4$. Upon tilting the sample to an angle of $\theta=20.3^o$ a clear FQH
state at emerges at $\nu=1/4$ with a plateau in the Hall resistance and a
strong minimum in the diagonal resistance.
