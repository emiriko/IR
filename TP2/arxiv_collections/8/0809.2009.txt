A series of 122 phase BaFe$_{2-x}$Ni$_x$As$_2$ ($x$ = 0, 0.055, 0.096, 0.18,
0.23) single crystals were grown by self flux method and a dome-like Ni doping
dependence of superconducting transition temperature is discovered. The
transition temperature $T_c^{on}$ reaches a maximum of 20.5 K at $x$ = 0.096,
and it drops to below 4 K as $x$ $\geq$ 0.23. The negative thermopower in the
normal state indicates that electron-like charge carrier indeed dominates in
this system. This Ni-doped system provides another example of superconductivity
induced by electron doping in the 122 phase.
