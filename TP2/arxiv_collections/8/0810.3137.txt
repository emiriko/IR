We have produced extended series for two-dimensional prudent polygons, based
on a transfer matrix algorithm of complexity O$(n^5),$ for a series of length
$n.$ We have extended the definition to three dimensions and produced series
expansions for both prudent walks and polygons in three dimensions. For prudent
polygons in two dimensions we find the growth constant to be smaller than that
for the corresponding walks, and by considering three distinct classes of
polygons, we find that the growth constant for polygons varies with class,
while for walks it does not. We give the critical exponent for both walks and
polygons. In the three-dimensional case we estimate the growth constant for
both walks and polygons and also estimate the usual critical exponents
$\gamma,$ $\nu$ and $\alpha.$
