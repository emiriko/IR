We explain how the redefinitions of supermultiplet component fields,
comprising what we call "frame shifts", can be used in conjuction with the
graphical technology of multiplet Adkinras to render manifest the reducibility
of off-shell representations of supersymmetry. This technology speaks to
possibility of organizing multiplet constraints in a way which complements and
extends the possibilities afforded by superspace methods.
