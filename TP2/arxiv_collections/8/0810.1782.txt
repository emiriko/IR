I introduce the properties of the light axial-vector mesons. The branching
ratios, longitudinal fractions and direct CP asymmetries of the related
charmless two-body B decays into final states involving two axial-vector mesons
($AA$) or one vector and one axial-vector meson ($VA$) are discussed within the
framework of QCD factorization.
