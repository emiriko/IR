Here $f(R)$-cosmology is discussed using a different approach. This model
explains early-inflation, emergence of cosmic background radiation at the exit
from inflation, cosmic deceleration during radiation-dominance followed by
deceleration due to curvature-induced matter and acceleration in the very late
universe due to curvature-induced phantom dark energy. This model predicts
collapse in the future universe. Further, a possible avoidence of collapse as
well as revival of very early universe is suggested.
