We report an experimental study of liquid drops moving against gravity, when
placed on a vertically vibrating inclined plate, which is partially wetted by
the drop. The frequency of vibrations ranges from 30 to 200 Hz, and, above a
threshold in vibration acceleration, drops experience an upward motion. We
attribute this surprising motion to the deformations of the drop, as a
consequence of an up or down symmetry breaking induced by the presence of the
substrate. We relate the direction of motion to contact angle measurements.
This phenomenon can be used to move a drop along an arbitrary path in a plane,
without special surface treatments or localized forcing.
