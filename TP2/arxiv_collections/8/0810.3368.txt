A detailed analysis has been made by R.Zavin and N.Moiseyev(2004 J. Phys. A:
Math, Gen, \textbf{37} 4619) for the change of bound states into resonance
states via coalescence of virtual states in a one-dimensional symmetric
rectangular attractive potential as it becomes shallow, with convergent wave
functions of virtual and resonance states by the complex scaling method. As a
complement to such an analysis, we discuss some global features of the pole
spectrum of the S-matrix by using a complex extension of the real potential
$V^{(\mathrm{real})}$ to $e^{i\alpha}V^{(\mathrm{real})}$ with a real phase
$\alpha$. We show the structures of trajectories of poles developed for the
change of $\alpha$ in the complex momentum plane, which is useful to understand
the mutual transformation among the bound, virtual and resonance states.
