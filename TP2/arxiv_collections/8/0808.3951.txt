A Pearson Effective Potential model for including quantization effects in the
simulation of nanoscale nMOSFETs has been developed. This model, based on a
realistic description of the function representing the non zero-size of the
electron wave packet, has been used in a Monte-Carlo simulator for bulk, single
gate SOI and double-gate SOI devices. In the case of SOI capacitors, the
electron density has been computed for a large range of effective field
(between 0.1 MV/cm and 1 MV/cm) and for various silicon film thicknesses
(between 5 nm and 20 nm). A good agreement with the Schroedinger-Poisson
results is obtained both on the total inversion charge and on the electron
density profiles. The ability of an Effective Potential approach to accurately
reproduce electrostatic quantum confinement effects is clearly demonstrated.
