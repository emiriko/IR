In this talk we survey some of the recent promising developments in the
search for the theory behind neutrino mass and mixing, and indeed all fermion
masses and mixing. The talk is organized in terms of a neutrino mass models
road map according to which the answers to experimental questions provide sign
posts to guide us through the maze of theoretical models eventually towards a
complete theory of flavour and unification.
