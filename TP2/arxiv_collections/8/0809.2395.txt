Currently available experimental data from electroweak precision observables
(EWPO), B-physics observables (BPO) and cosmological data can be combined to
extract the preferred value of SUSY mass scales. We review recent results on
the predictions of the masses of supersymmetric particles and the indirect
determination of the lightest Higgs boson mass. Special emphasis is put on
models going beyond the Constrained Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model
(CMSSM), such as the Non-Universal Higgs Model type I (NUHM1), or gauge and
anomaloy mediated SUSY breaking.
