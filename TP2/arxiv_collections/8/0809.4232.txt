We describe the set of bounded harmonic functions for the Heckman--Opdam
Laplacian, when the multiplicity function is larger than 1/2. We prove that
this set is a vector space of dimension the cardinality of the Weyl group. We
give some consequences in terms of the associated hypergeometric functions.
