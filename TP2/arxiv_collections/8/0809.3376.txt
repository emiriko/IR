We have examined the possible construction of a stationary, spherically
symmetric and spatially inhomogeneous wormhole spacetime supported by the
phantom energy. The later is supposed to be represented by the modified
Chaplygin gas equation of state. The solutions so obtained satisfy the flare
out and the asymptotic flatness conditions. It is also shown that the averaged
null energy condition has to be violated for the existence of the wormhole.
