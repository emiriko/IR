We use the informations known so far about elementary particles in order to
construct a simple model. We find a reason for the gyromagnetic factor of 2 for
leptons and a vivid imagination for the weak interaction. By this, we
understand, why the elementary particles with lowest mass are stable and all
other unstable.
