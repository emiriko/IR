The Lp operator norm of the generalized Beurling-Ahlfors transformation in n
variables is at most (n/2+1)(p-1) for p>2. This improves on earlier results in
all dimensions n>2. The proof is based on the heat extension and relies at the
bottom on Burkholder's sharp inequality for martingale transforms.
