LDA+DMFT method in the framework of the iterative perturbation theory (IPT)
with full LDA Hamiltonian without mapping onto the effective Wannier orbitals.
We then apply this LDA+DMFT method to ferromagnetic bcc-Fe and fcc-Ni as a test
of transition metal, and to antiferromagnetic NiO as an example of transition
metal oxide. In Fe and Ni, the width of occupied 3d bands is narrower than
those in LDA and Ni 6eV satellite appears. In NiO, the resultant electronic
structure is of charge-transfer insulator type and the band gap is 4.3eV. These
results are in good agreement with the experimental XPS. The configuration
mixing and dynamical correlation effects play a crucial role in these results.
