Methods on reducing resonant frequencies and electrical sizes of resonators
are reported in this paper. Theoreti-cal and numerical analysis has been used
and the results for the broadside-coupled resonators from both studies exhibit
good agreement. Initial fabrication techniques are proposed and measurement
results are compared with simulations. Further high resolution techniques have
been envisaged to enhance the performance of the resona-tors. This class of
small resonators with low resonant frequencies indicates a variety of
applications in the design of microwave devices.
