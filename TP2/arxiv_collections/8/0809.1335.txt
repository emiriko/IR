This talk summarises the ongoing proposals to upgrade the ATLAS and CMS
detectors by the installation of forward silicon detector systems close to the
beam line at distances of approximately 220 m and 420 m from the respective
Interaction Points. The physics motivation is outlined, with emphasis on
detection of Higgs and Supersymmetric states, and some of the aspects of the
apparatus and its performance are briefly described.
