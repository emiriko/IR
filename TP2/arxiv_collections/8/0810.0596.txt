We show that a continuous action of a quantum semigroup $\mathcal{S}$ on a
finite quantum space (finite dimensional $\mathrm{C}^*$-algebra) preserving a
faithful state comes from a continuous action of the quantum Bohr
compactification $\mathfrak{b}\mathcal{S}$ of $\mathcal{S}$. Using the
classification of continuous compact quantum group actions on $M_2$ we give a
complete description of all continuous quantum semigroup actions on this
quantum space preserving a faithful state.
