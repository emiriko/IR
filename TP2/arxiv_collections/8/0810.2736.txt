The decay constants and the radiative decay widths of \eta_b(nS) and
\eta_c(nS) are computed within a semirelativistic quark model, using a
potential found through the AdS/QCD correspondence. For \eta_c, the results are
in agreement with experimental data, while in the case of \eta'_c a discrepancy
is found and the possible reasons are discussed.
