We obtain tree-level estimates of various differential branching ratios of
heavy baryon decays with massive sterile neutrinos $\nu_{x}$ in the final
state. Heavy sterile neutrinos can be searched for in heavy baryon decays with
missing mass as a signature as well as in fixed target experiments, where heavy
baryon decays contribute to sterile neutrino production, with sterile neutrino
decays as a signature. Generally, charmed baryons are found to be less
promising than charmed mesons, in contrast to b-hadrons. In the latter case,
branching ratios of beauty mesons and baryons into sterile neutrinos are of the
same order. As a consequence, at high energies beauty baryons give contribution
to sterile neutrino production comparable to the contribution of beauty mesons
(up to about 15%). Experimental limits on active-to-sterile mixing are quite
strong for neutrinos lighter than D-meson but for heavier neutrinos they are
weaker. As an example, for neutrino masses in the range 2 GeV $\lesssim
m_{\nu_{x}}\lesssim 2.5$ GeV, current data imply that the bounds on
$\Lambda_{b}$-hyperon branching ratios into sterile neutrinos are ${\rm
Br}(\Lambda_b\to\Lambda_c+e^-+\nu_x)\lesssim 1.3\cdot10^{-5}-1.7\cdot10^{-6}$
and ${\rm Br}(\Lambda_b\to\Lambda_c+\mu^-+\nu_x)\lesssim
3.9\cdot10^{-7}-1.4\cdot10^{-7}$.
