Faithful exchange of quantum information can in future become a key part of
many computational algorithms. Some Authors suggest to use chains of mutually
coupled spins as channels for quantum communication. One can divide these
proposals into the groups of assisted protocols, which require some additional
action from the users, and natural ones, based on the concept of state
mirroring. We show that mirror is fundamentally not the feature chains of
spins-1/2 coupled by the Heisenberg interaction, but without local magnetic
fields. This fact has certain consequences in terms of the natural state
transfer.
