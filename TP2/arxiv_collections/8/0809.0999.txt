For a chaotic cavity with two indentical leads each supporting N channels, we
compute analytically, for large N, the full distribution of the conductance and
the shot noise power and show that in both cases there is a central Gaussian
region flanked on both sides by non-Gaussian tails. The distribution is weakly
singular at the junction of Gaussian and non-Gaussian regimes, a direct
consequence of two phase transitions in an associated Coulomb gas problem.
