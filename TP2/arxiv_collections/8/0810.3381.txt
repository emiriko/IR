Group symmetric LOCC measurement for detecting maximally entangled state is
considered. Usually, this type measurement has continuous-valued outcomes.
However, any realizable measurement has finite-valued outcomes. This paper
proposes discrete realizations of such a group symmetric LOCC measurement.
