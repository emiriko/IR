We generalize a construction of the Neron model for a family of intermediate
Jacobians due to Green, Griffiths and Kerr by using the theory of mixed Hodge
modules. It is a topological group defined over any partial compactification of
the base space, and it `graphs' admissible normal functions. Moreover, there is
a stratification of the partial compactification such that the restriction over
each stratum is a complex Lie group over the stratum.
