Spatial step edge fluctuations on a multi-component surface of
Al/Si(111)-(root3 x root3) were measured via scanning tunneling microscopy over
a temperature range of 720K-1070K, for step lengths of L = 65-160 nm. Even
though the time scale of fluctuations of steps on this surface varies by orders
of magnitude over the indicated temperature ranges, measured first-passage
spatial persistence and survival probabilities are temperature independent. The
power law functional form for spatial persistence probabilities is confirmed
and the symmetric spatial persistence exponent is measured to be theta = 0.498
+/- 0.062 in agreement with the theoretical prediction theta = 1/2. The
survival probability is found to scale directly with y/L, where y is the
distance along the step edge. The form of the survival probabilities agree
quantitatively with the theoretical prediction, which yields exponential decay
in the limit of small y/L. The decay constant is found experimentally to be
ys/L= 0.076 +/- 0.033 for y/L <= 0.2.
