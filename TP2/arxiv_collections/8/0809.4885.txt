Developing a non-compact version of the SUSY Hopf map, we formulate the
quantum Hall effect on a super-hyperboloid. Based on $OSp(1|2)$ group
theoretical methods, we first analyze the one-particle Landau problem, and
successively explore the many-body problem where Laughlin wavefunction,
hard-core pseudo-potential Hamiltonian and topological excitations are derived.
It is also shown that the fuzzy super-hyperboloid emerges in the lowest Landau
level.
