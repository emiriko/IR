We study the magnetic structure of the (LaMnO$_3$)$_{2n}$/(SrMnO$_3$)$_n$
superlattices from density-functional calculations. In agreement with the
experiments, we find that the magnetism changes with the layer thickness `n'.
The reason for the different magnetic structures is shown to be the varying
potential barrier across the interface, which controls the leakage of the
Mn-e$_g$ electrons from the LMO side to the SMO side. This in turn affects the
interfacial magnetism via the carrier-mediated Zener double exchange. For n=1
superlattice, the Mn-e$_g$ electrons are more or less spread over the entire
lattice, so that the magnetic behavior is similar to the equivalent alloy
compound La$_{2/3}$Sr$_{1/3}$MnO$_3$. For larger n, the e$_g$ electron transfer
occurs mostly between the two layers adjacent to the interface, thus leaving
the magnetism unchanged and bulk-like away from the interface region.
