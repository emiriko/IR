After a brief discussion about the necessity of using the 3D approach, we
present the non PW formalism for 3N bound state with the inclusion of 3N force
(3NF). As an example the evaluation of 3NF matrix elements, which appear in the
obtained coupled three dimensional integral equations, for $2\pi$-exchange
Tucson-Melbourne 3NF show how would be this formalism efficient and less
cumbersome in comparison with the PW formalism.
