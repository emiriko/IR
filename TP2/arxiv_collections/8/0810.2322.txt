We present a new theoretical approach to attosecond laser-assisted photo- and
Compton ionization. Attosecond x-ray absorption and scattering are described by
$\hat{\mathrsfs{S}}^{(1,2)}$-matrices, which are coherent superpositions of
"monochromatic" $\hat{S}^{(1,2)}$-matrices in a laser-modified Furry
representation. Besides refining the existing theory of the soft x-ray
photoelectron attosecond streak camera and spectral phase interferometry (ASC
and ASPI), we formulate a theory of hard x-ray photoelectron and Compton ASC
and ASPI. The resulting scheme has a simple structure and leads to closed-form
expressions for ionization amplitudes. We investigate Compton electron
interference in the separable Coulomb-Volkov continuum with both Coulomb and
laser fields treated non-perturbatively. We find that at laser-field
intensities below 10$^{13}$ Wcm$^{-2}$ normalized Compton lines almost coincide
with the lines obtained in the laser-free regime. At higher intensities,
attosecond interferences survive integration over electron momenta, and feature
prominently in the Compton lines themselves. We define a regime where the
electron ground-state density can be measured with controllable accuracy in an
attosecond time interval. The new theory provides a firm basis for extracting
photo- and Compton electron phases and atomic and molecular wavefunctions from
experimental data.
