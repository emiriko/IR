I studied experimentally the beam self-collimation and splitting in
two-dimensional microwave photonic crystals. Using a microwave photonic crystal
fabricated from alumina rods, I present an experimental proof of principle for
an earlier theoretical proposal [A. Matthews et al., Opt. Commun. 279, 313
(2007)] of a photonic crystal beam splitter based on the self-collimation
effect.
