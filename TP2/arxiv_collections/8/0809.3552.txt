Conductive polymers or "organic metals" are highly engineered nanostructured
materials made from organic building blocks. They are candidates as molecular
wires for nanotechnology applications in molecular electronics. The conduction
in these polymers is due to the presence of delocalized molecular orbitals. In
this work, we present the synthesis of chloride doped polyaniline by bulk
oxidative chemical polymerization using a solid aniline salt as a monomer
instead of liquid aniline to diminish toxic hazards. The FTIR and UV-visible
spectra confirmed the expected structure of the polymer. The electrical
conductivity measured using a four-probe method was 1.7 S/cm. The dependence of
impedance modulus on frequency was measured using an HP impedance analyzer in
the range 10 kHz-13 MHz. The influence of doping and the preparation
temperature on the electrical conductivity were also investigated.
