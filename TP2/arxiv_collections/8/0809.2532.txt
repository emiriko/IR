Most generic performance tools display only system-level performance data
using 2-dimensional plots or diagrams and this limits the informational detail
that can be displayed. Moreover, a modern relational database system, like
Oracle, can concurrently serve thousands of client processes with different
workload characteristics, so that generic performance-data displays inevitably
hide important information. Drawing on our previous work, this paper
demonstrates the application of Barry007 multidimensional visualization to the
analysis of Oracle end-user, session-level, performance data, showing both
collective trends and individual performance anomalies.
