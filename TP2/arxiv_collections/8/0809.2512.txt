A simple mechanical device is introduced, the parallelometer, that can be
used to measure curvatures of surfaces. The device can be used as a practical
illustration of parallel transport of a vector and to study Berry phase shift
when it is carried along a loop on the surface. Its connection to the Foucault
pendulum is discussed. The experimental results can be successfully compared
with the theoretical expectations. The experiment is inexpensive and
conceptually easy to perform and understand for a beginner.
