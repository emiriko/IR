We consider the structure of the derived categories of coherent sheaves on
Fano threefolds with Picard number 1 and describe a strange relation between
derived categories of different threefolds. In the Appendix we discuss how the
ring of algebraic cycles of a smooth projective variety is related to the
Grothendieck group of its derived category.
