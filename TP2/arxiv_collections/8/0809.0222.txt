We derive new QCD sum rules for $B\to D$ and $B\to D^*$ form factors. The
underlying correlation functions are expanded near the light-cone in terms of
$B$-meson distribution amplitudes defined in HQET, whereas the $c$-quark mass
is kept finite. The leading-order contributions of two- and three-particle
distribution amplitudes are taken into account. From the resulting light-cone
sum rules we calculate all $B\to \Dst $ form factors in the region of small
momentum transfer (maximal recoil). In the infinite heavy-quark mass limit the
sum rules reduce to a single expression for the Isgur-Wise function. We compare
our predictions with the form factors extracted from experimental $B\to \Dst l
\nu_l$ decay rates fitted to dispersive parameterizations.
