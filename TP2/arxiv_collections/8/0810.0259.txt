In this note, we study some properties of the GHZ state. First, we present a
quantum secret sharing scheme in which the participants require only classical
channels in order to reconstruct the secret; our protocol is significantly more
efficient than the trivial usage of teleportation. Second, we show that the
classical simulation of an n-party GHZ state requires at least n log n - 2n
bits of communication. Finally, we present a problem simpler than the complete
simulation of the multi-party GHZ state, that could lead to a no-go theorem for
GHZ state simulation.
