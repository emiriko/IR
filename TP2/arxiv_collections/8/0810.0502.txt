We report on our recent measurements of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa
CP-violating phase gamma and of related CP-asymmetries and branching fraction
ratios. The measurements have been performed on samples of up to 465 million
BBbar pairs collected by the BaBar detector at the SLAC PEP-II
asymmetric-energy B factory in the years 1999-2007.
