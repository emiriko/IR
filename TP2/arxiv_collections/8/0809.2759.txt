We address the possible impact of New Physics on neutrino oscillation
experiments. This can modify the neutrino production, propagation and/or
detection, making the full cross section non-factorizable in general. Thus, for
example, the neutrino flux may not be properly described assuming an unitary
MNS matrix and/or neutrinos may propagate differently depending of their Dirac
or Majorana character. Interestingly enough, present limits on New Physics
still allow for observable effects at future neutrino experiments.
