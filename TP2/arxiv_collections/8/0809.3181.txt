Muscle fatigue is defined as the point at which the muscle is no longer able
to sustain the required force or work output level. The overexertion of muscle
force and muscle fatigue can induce acute pain and chronic pain in human body.
When muscle fatigue is accumulated, the functional disability can be resulted
as musculoskeletal disorders (MSD). There are several posture exposure analysis
methods useful for rating the MSD risks, but they are mainly based on static
postures. Even in some fatigue evaluation methods, muscle fatigue evaluation is
only available for static postures, but not suitable for dynamic working
process. Meanwhile, some existing muscle fatigue models based on physiological
models cannot be easily used in industrial ergonomic evaluations. The external
dynamic load is definitely the most important factor resulting muscle fatigue,
thus we propose a new fatigue model under a framework for evaluating fatigue in
dynamic working processes. Under this framework, virtual reality system is
taken to generate virtual working environment, which can be interacted with the
work with haptic interfaces and optical motion capture system. The motion
information and load information are collected and further processed to
evaluate the overall work load of the worker based on dynamic muscle fatigue
models and other work evaluation criterions and to give new information to
characterize the penibility of the task in design process.
