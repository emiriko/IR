Single transverse-spin asymmetries have been studied intensively both in
experiment and theory. Theoretically, two factorization approaches have been
proposed. One is by using transverse-momentum-dependent factorization and the
asymmetry comes from the so called Sivers function. Another is by using
collinear factorization where the nonperturbative effect is parameterized by a
twist-3 hadronic matrix element. However, the factorized formulas for the
asymmetries in the two approaches are derived at hadron level formally by
diagram expansion, where one works with various parton density matrices of
hadrons. If the two factorizations hold, they should also hold at parton level.
We examine this for Drell-Yan processes by replacing hadrons with partons. By
calculating the asymmetry, Sivers function and the twist-3 matrix element at
nontrivial leading order of $\alpha_s$, we find that we can reproduce the
result of the transverse-momentum-dependent factorization. But we can only
verify the result of the collinear factorization partly. Two formally derived
relations between Sivers function and the twist-3 matrix element are also
examined with negative results.
