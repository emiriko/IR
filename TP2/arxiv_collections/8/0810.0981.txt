We show that (equivariant) K-theoretic 3-point Gromov-Witten invariants of
genus zero on a Grassmann variety are equal to triple intersections computed in
the ordinary (equivariant) K-theory of a two-step flag manifold, thus
generalizing an earlier result of Buch, Kresch, and Tamvakis. In the process we
show that the Gromov-Witten variety of curves passing through 3 general points
is irreducible and rational. Our applications include Pieri and Giambelli
formulas for the quantum K-theory ring of a Grassmannian, which determine the
multiplication in this ring. Our formula for Gromov-Witten invariants can be
partially generalized to cominuscule homogeneous spaces by using a construction
of Chaput, Manivel, and Perrin.
