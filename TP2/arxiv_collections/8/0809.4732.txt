By the first-principles electronic structure calculations, we find that the
ground state of PbO-type tetragonal $\alpha$-FeTe is in a bi-collinear
antiferromagnetic state, in which the Fe local moments ($\sim2.5\mu_B$) are
ordered ferromagnetically along a diagonal direction and antiferromagnetically
along the other diagonal direction on the Fe square lattice. This bi-collinear
order results from the interplay among the nearest, next nearest, and next next
nearest neighbor superexchange interactions $J_1$, $J_2$, and $J_3$, mediated
by Te $5p$-band. In contrast, the ground state of $\alpha$-FeSe is in the
collinear antiferromagnetic order, similar as in LaFeAsO and BaFe$_2$As$_2$.
