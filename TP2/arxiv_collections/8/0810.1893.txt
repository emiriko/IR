For two or more classes of points in $\R^d$ with $d \ge 1$, the class cover
catch digraphs (CCCDs) can be constructed using the relative positions of the
points from one class with respect to the points from the other class. The
CCCDs were introduced by (Priebe, DeVinney, and Mar-chette, (2001). On the
distribution of the domination number of random class catch cover di-graphs.
Statistics and Probability Letters, 55:239-246) who investigated the case of
two classes, $\X$ and $\Y$. They calculated the exact (finite sample)
distribution of the domination number of the CCCDs based on $\X$ points
relative to $\Y$ points both of which were uniformly distri-buted on a bounded
interval. We investigate the distribution of the domination number of the CCCDs
based on data from non-uniform $\X$ points on an interval with end points from
$\Y$. Then we extend these calculations for multiple $\Y$ points on bounded
intervals.
