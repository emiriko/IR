We investigate the modification of the intrinsic carrier noise spectral
density induced in low-doped semiconductor materials by an external correlated
noise source added to the driving high-frequency periodic electric field. A
Monte Carlo approach is adopted to numerically solve the transport equation by
considering all the possible scattering phenomena of the hot electrons in the
medium. We show that the noise spectra are strongly affected by the intensity
and the correlation time of the external random electric field. Moreover this
random field can cause a suppression of the total noise power.
