By using canonical Monte Carlo simulation, the liquid-vapor phase diagram,
surface tension, interface width, and pressure for the Mie(n,m) model fluids
are calculated for six pairs of parameters $m$ and $n$. It is shown that after
certain re-scaling of fluid density the corresponding states rule can be
applied for the calculations of the thermodynamic properties of the Mie model
fluids, and for some real substances
