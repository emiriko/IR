We calculate the electronic band structure of ABA-stacked trilayer graphene
in the presence of external gates, using a self-consistent Hartree
approximation to take account of screening. In the absence of a gate potential,
there are separate pairs of linear and parabolic bands at low energy. A gate
field perpendicular to the layers breaks mirror reflection symmetry with
respect to the central layer and hybridizes the linear and parabolic low-energy
bands, leaving a chiral Hamiltonian essentially different from that of
monolayer or bilayer graphene. Using the self-consistent Born approximation, we
find that the density of states and the minimal conductivity in the presence of
disorder generally increase as the gate field increases, in sharp contrast with
bilayer graphene.
