We investigate the performance of the recently proposed stationary
Fokker-Planck sampling method considering a combinatorial optimization problem
from statistical physics. The algorithmic procedure relies upon the numerical
solution of a linear second order differential equation that depends on a
diffusion-like parameter D. We apply it to the problem of finding ground states
of 2d Ising spin glasses for the +-J-Model. We consider square lattices with
side length up to L=24 with two different types of boundary conditions and
compare the results to those obtained by exact methods.
  A particular value of D is found that yields an optimal performance of the
algorithm. We compare this optimal value of D to a percolation transition,
which occurs when studying the connected clusters of spins flipped by the
algorithm. Nevertheless, even for moderate lattice sizes, the algorithm has
more and more problems to find the exact ground states. This means that the
approach, at least in its standard form, seems to be inferior to other
approaches like parallel tempering.
