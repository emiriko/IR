In this work we study the flavor changing neutral current(FCNC) decays of the
top quark, $t\to c\gamma$ and $t\to c g$. The Standard Model, predictions for
the branching ratios of these decays are about $\sim 5\times 10^{-14}$, and
$\sim 1\times 10^{-12}$, respectively. The recent study presented by the ATLAS
Collaboration gives a sensitivity on these branching ratios about $\sim
10^{-5}$ at $%95$ C.L. The parameter space of $\lambda$, $\Lambda$, and $d$
where the branching ratios of $t\to c\gamma$ and $t\to c g$ decays exceed these
predictions is obtained.
