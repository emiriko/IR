We discuss the collider signatures of electroweak (1,0)-mode excitations in
the framework of two universal extra dimension (2UED) at the LHC and ILC. In
general, pair production of electroweak (1,0)-mode particles of 2UED gives rise
to multi lepton plus missing transverse momentum signal. Upto 1/R = 400 GeV two
lepton plus missing transverse momentum signal and upto 1/R = 600 GeV three
lepton plus missing transverse momentum signal stands over the $5\sigma$
standard deviation of the Standard Model background at the LHC with $100
fb^{-1}$ integrated luminosity. At ILC we study single photon plus missing
energy signal from the production of U(1) gauge boson in association with a
U(1) spinless adjoint. With proper choice of beam polarization, signal strength
is greater than $5\sigma$ standard deviation of the Standard Model background
almost upto the kinematic limit of the collider.
