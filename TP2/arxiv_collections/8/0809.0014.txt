Multiband superconductivity, involving resonant pair scattering between
different bands, has emerged as a possible explanation of some of the main
characteristics of the recently discovered iron pnictides. A key feature of
such interband pairing mechanism is that it can generate or enhance
superconducting pairing irrespective of whether it is attractive or repulsive.
The latter case typically leads to the superconducting gap switching its sign
among different sections of the Fermi surface. In iron pnictides, the natural
scenario is that the gap changes sign between the hole and the electron Fermi
surfaces. However, the macroscopic symmetry of such an extended s'-wave state
still belongs to the general s-wave category, raising the question of how to
distinguish it from an ordinary s-wave. In such a quest, it is essential to use
experimental techniques that have a momentum space resolution and can probe
momenta of order M, the wavevector that separates the hole and the electron
Fermi surfaces in the Brillouin zone. Here we study experimental signatures in
the spin fluctuation dynamics of the fully-gapped s- and s'-wave
superconducting states, as well as those of the nodal d- and p-wave. The
coupling between spin fluctuations of the incipient nearly-nested spin
density-wave (SDW) and the Bogoliubov-deGennes quasiparticles of the
superconducting state leads to the Landau-type damping of the former. The
intrinsic structure of the superconducting gap leaves a distinctive signature
in the form of this damping, allowing it to be used to diagnose the nature of
iron-based superconductivity in neutron scattering and other experiments
sensitive to spin fluctuations in momentum space. We also discuss the
coexistence between superconductivity and SDW order.
