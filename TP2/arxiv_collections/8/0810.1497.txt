We study signals at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) for the Kaluza-Klein (KK)
excitations of electroweak charged gauge bosons in the framework of the
Standard Model (SM) fields propagating in the bulk of a warped extra dimension.
Such a scenario can solve both the Planck-weak and flavor hierarchy problems of
the SM. There are two such charged states in this scenario with couplings to
light quarks and leptons being suppressed relative to those in the SM, whereas
the couplings to top/bottom quarks are enhanced, similar to the case of
electroweak neutral gauge bosons previously studied. However, unlike the case
of electroweak neutral gauge bosons, there is no irreducible QCD background
(including pollution from possibly degenerate KK gluons) for decays to top +
bottom final state so that this channel is useful for the discovery of the
charged states. Moreover, decays of electroweak charged gauge bosons to
longitudinal W, Z and Higgs are enhanced just as for the neutral bosons.
However, unlike for the neutral gauge bosons, the purely leptonic (and hence
clean) decay mode of the WZ are fully reconstructible so that the ratio of the
signal to the SM (electroweak) background can potentially be enhanced by
restricting to the resonance region more efficiently. We show that such final
states can give sensitivity to 2 (3) TeV masses with an integrated luminosity
of 100 (300) inverse fb. We emphasize that improvements in discriminating a
QCD-jet from a highly boosted hadronically decaying W, and a highly boosted
top-jet from a bottom-jet will enhance the reach for these KK particles, and
that the signals we study for the warped extra dimensional model might actually
be applicable also to a wider class of non-supersymmetric models of electroweak
symmetry breaking.
