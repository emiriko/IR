We present CDF results on the branching fractions and time-integrated direct
CP asymmetries for Bd, Bs and Lb decay modes into pairs of charmless charged
hadrons (pions, kaons and protons). The data-set for these measurements amounts
to 1fb^{-1} of pbar-p collisions at a center of mass energy 1.96TeV. We report
on the first observation of the Bs->Kpi, Lb-ppi and Lb->pK decay modes and on
the measurement of their branching fractions and direct CP asymmetries.
