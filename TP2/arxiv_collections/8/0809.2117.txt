In this paper we investigate the influence of directed motifs on the
synchronization properties of Kuramoto oscillators on directed networks.
Building different types of sparse directed small world networks similar to the
Watts and Strogatz procedure we establish that feed forward loops favour
synchronization on directed networks. The paper highlights the importance of
local network characteristics for synchronization.
