Nonthermal fixed points represent basic properties of quantum field theories,
in addition to vacuum or thermal equilibrium fixed points. The functional
renormalization group on a closed real-time path provides a common framework
for their description. For the example of an O(N) symmetric scalar theory it
reveals a hierarchy of fixed point solutions, with increasing complexity from
vacuum and thermal equilibrium to nonequilibrium.
