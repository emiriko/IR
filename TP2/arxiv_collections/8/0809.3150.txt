We detail and extend the results of [Milman {\it et al.}, Phys. Rev. Lett.
{\bf 99}, 130405 (2007)] on Bell-type inequalities based on correlations
between measurements of continuous observables performed on trapped molecular
systems. We show that for some observables with a continuous spectrum which is
bounded, one is able to construct non-locality tests sharing common properties
with those for two-level systems. The specific observable studied here is
molecular spatial orientation, and it can be experimentally measured for single
molecules, as required in our protocol. We also provide some useful general
properties of the derived inequalities and study their robustness to noise.
Finally, we detail possible experimental scenarii and analyze the role played
by different experimental parameters.
