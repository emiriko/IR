For quadratic spaces which represent 1 there is a characterization of
hermitian compositions in the language of algebras-with-involutions using the
even Clifford algebra. We extend this notion to define a generalized
composition based on quadratic pairs and determine the degrees of minimal
compositions for any given quadratic pair.
