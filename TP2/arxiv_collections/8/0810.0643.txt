We study the transition from a Mott insulator to a superfluid in both the
two- and the three-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model at zero temperature,
employing the method of the effective potential. Converting Kato's perturbation
series into an algorithm capable of reaching high orders, we obtain accurate
critical parameters for any integer filling factor. Our technique allows us to
monitor both the approach to the mean-field limit by considering spatial
dimensionalities $d > 3$, and to the quantum rotor limit of high filling, which
refers to an array of Josephson junctions.
