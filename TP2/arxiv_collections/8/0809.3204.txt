We introduce an extended tableau calculus for answer set programming (ASP).
The proof system is based on the ASP tableaux defined in [Gebser&Schaub, ICLP
2006], with an added extension rule. We investigate the power of Extended ASP
Tableaux both theoretically and empirically. We study the relationship of
Extended ASP Tableaux with the Extended Resolution proof system defined by
Tseitin for sets of clauses, and separate Extended ASP Tableaux from ASP
Tableaux by giving a polynomial-length proof for a family of normal logic
programs P_n for which ASP Tableaux has exponential-length minimal proofs with
respect to n. Additionally, Extended ASP Tableaux imply interesting insight
into the effect of program simplification on the lengths of proofs in ASP.
Closely related to Extended ASP Tableaux, we empirically investigate the effect
of redundant rules on the efficiency of ASP solving.
