This talk is a review of possible discoveries of exotic not Standard Model
Physics in the early stage of LHC (first two years), with the ATLAS and CMS
experiments. LHC will be the first experiment ever to explore the TeV region
and new exotic particles could be discovered at early stages of the LHC running
if their masses are not too large. This talk is focused on three main search
topics: new vector bosons, contact interaction and extra dimensions.
