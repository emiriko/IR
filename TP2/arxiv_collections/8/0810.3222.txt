Recently V. A. Yampol'skii, S. Savel'ev, Z. A. Mayselis, S. S. Apostolov, and
F. Nori [Phys. Rev. Lett., v.101, 096803 (2008),arXiv:0712.1395] claimed that
the Casimir force between a thin metal film described by the Drude model and an
ideal metal semispace can decrease with temperature whereas for bulk samples
the Casimir force increases with temperature. On this basis the experimental
observation of the decreasing temperature dependence of the Casimir force
magnitude between a film and a bulk ideal metal was proposed. We demonstrate
that, contrary to what is claimed by the authors, the magnitude of the Casimir
force decreases with temperature in a wide temperature region for bulk samples
described by the Drude model. This decrease is shown to be much larger than
that for a thin film and it has already been experimentally excluded.
