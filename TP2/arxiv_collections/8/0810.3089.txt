We demonstrate that nonextensive perfect relativistic hydrodynamics
($q$-hydrodynamics) can serve as a model of the usual relativistic dissipative
hydrodynamics ($d$-hydrodynamics) facilitating therefore considerably its
applications. As illustration we show how using $q$-hydrodynamics one gets the
$q$-dependent expressions for the dissipative entropy current and the
corresponding ratios of the bulk and shear viscosities to entropy density,
$\zeta/s$ and $\eta/s$.
