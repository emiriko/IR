Epitaxial NdBa2Cu3O7-x films with a hybrid nanoscale defect structure
comprised of BaZrO3 nanodot arrays aligned along the c-axis in one half of the
film thickness and aligned perpendicular to the c-axis in the other half
thickness of the film were fabricated. Transmission electron microscopy images
confirm the orientation of the nanoscale defect structures. The angular
dependence of critical current density, Jc, at 77 K, 1 T, shows significantly
reduced angular variation of Jc. This study nicely demonstrates how pinning
characteristics can be tuned by tuning the nanoscale defect structures within
the films.
