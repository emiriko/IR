Protein electrostatic states have been demonstrated to play crucial roles in
catalysis, ligand binding, protein stability, and in the modulation of
allosteric effects. Electrostatic states are demonstrated to appear conserved
among DEAD-box motifs and evidence is presented that the structural changes
that occur to DEAD box proteins upon ligand binding alter the DEAD-box motif
electrostatics in a way the facilitates the catalytic role of the DEAD-box
glutatmate.
