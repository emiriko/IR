We numerically compute the string tension in the large N limit of three
dimensional Yang-Mills theory using Wilson loops. Space-time Wilson loops are
formed using smeared space-like links and unsmeared time-like links. We use
partial reduction and both unfolded and folded Wilson loops in the analysis.
