Electromagnetic resonant cavities form the basis of many tests of Lorentz
invariance involving photons. The effects of some forms of Lorentz violation
scale with cavity size. We investigate possible signals of violations in the
naturally occurring resonances formed in the Earth-ionosphere cavity.
Comparison with observed resonances places the first terrestrial constraints on
coefficients associated with dimension-three Lorentz-violating operators at the
level of 10^{-20} GeV.
