Recent investigations show that conservation laws limit the accuracy of gate
operations in quantum computing. The inevitable error under the angular
momentum conservation law has been evaluated so far for the CNOT, Hadamard, and
NOT gates for spin 1/2 qubits, while the SWAP gate has no constraint. Here, we
extend the above results to general single-qubit gates. We obtain an upper
bound of the gate fidelity of arbitrary single-qubit gates implemented under
arbitrary conservation laws, determined by the geometry of the conservation law
and the gate operation on the Bloch sphere as well as the size of the ancilla.
