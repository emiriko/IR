We investigate the geometric properties displayed by the magnetic patterns
developing on a two-dimensional Ising system, when a diffusive thermal dynamics
is adopted. Such a dynamics is generated by a random walker which diffuses
throughout the sites of the lattice, updating the relevant spins. Since the
walker is biased towards borders between clusters, the border-sites are more
likely to be updated with respect to a non-diffusive dynamics and therefore, we
expect the spin configurations to be affected. In particular, by means of the
box-counting technique, we measure the fractal dimension of magnetic patterns
emerging on the lattice, as the temperature is varied. Interestingly, our
results provide a geometric signature of the phase transition and they also
highlight some non-trivial, quantitative differences between the behaviors
pertaining to the diffusive and non-diffusive dynamics.
