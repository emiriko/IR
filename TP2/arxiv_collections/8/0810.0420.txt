The international Muon Ionization Cooling Experiment (MICE) will carry out a
systematic investigation of ionization cooling of a muon beam. As the emittance
measurement will be done on a particle-by-particle basis, sophisticated beam
instrumentation is needed to measure particle coordinates and timing vs RF. A
PID system based on three time-of-flight stations, two Aerogel Cerenkov
detectors and a KLOE-like calorimeter has been constructed in order to keep
beam contamination ($e, \pi$) well below 1%. The MICE time-of-flight system
will measure timing with a resolution better than 70 ps per plane, in a harsh
environment due to high particle rates, fringe magnetic fields and electron
backgrounds from RF dark current.
