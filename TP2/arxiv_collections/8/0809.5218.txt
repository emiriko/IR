Generalising expressions given by Komar, we give precise definitions of
gravitational mass and solitonic NUT charge and we apply these to the
description of a class of Minkowski-signature multi-Taub-NUT solutions without
rod singularities. A Wick rotation then yields the corresponding class of
Euclidean-signature gravitational multi-instantons.
