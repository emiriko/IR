In order to study an interplay of disorder, correlation, and spin imbalance
on antiferromagnetism, we systematically explore the ground state of
one-dimensional spin-imbalanced Anderson-Hubbard model by using the
density-matrix renormalization group method. We find that disorders localize
the antiferromagnetic spin density wave induced by imbalanced fermions and the
increase of the disorder magnitude shrinks the areas of the localized
antiferromagnetized regions. Moreover, the antiferromagnetism finally
disappears above a large disorder. These behaviors are observable in atomic
Fermi gases loaded on optical lattices and disordered strongly-correlated
chains under magnetic field.
