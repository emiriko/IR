We discuss the aspects of the little Higgs model with the $SU(4)_L \times
U(1)_X$ electroweak gauge group as an alternative solution to the naturalness
and fine-tuning issues. We introduce anomaly-free fermion spectra, and present
their interactions with the physical gauge bosons. We also discuss some
phenomenological implications of these fermions and the extra gauge bosons
based on recent experimental results.
