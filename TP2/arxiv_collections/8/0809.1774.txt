We address polarization-induced renormalization of molecular levels in
solid-state based single-molecule transistors and focus on an organic conjugate
molecule where a surprisingly large reduction of the addition energy has been
observed. We have developed a scheme that combines a self-consistent solution
of a quantum chemical calculation with a realistic description of the screening
environment. Our results indeed show a large reduction, and we explain this to
be a consequence of both (a) a reduction of the electrostatic molecular
charging energy and (b) polarization induced level shifts of the HOMO and LUMO
levels. Finally, we calculate the charge stability diagram and explain at a
qualitative level general features observed experimentally.
