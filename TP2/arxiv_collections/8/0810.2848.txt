The wobbling excitations of the triaxial superdeformed (TSD) bands in the Lu
and Hf region are studied by the microscopic framework of the cranked
mean-field and the random-phase approximation (RPA). In contrast to the
previous works, where the Nilsson potential was used, the more realistic
Woods-Saxon potential is employed as a nuclear mean-field. The wobbling-like
RPA solutions have been found systematically in the nuclei studied and their
characteristic properties are investigated in details. This confirms the
wobbling phonon excitations in TSD nuclei from the microscopic calculations.
The result of $B(E2)$ values indicates that the triaxial deformation is
increasing as a function of spin in the observed TSD bands in $^{163}$Lu.
