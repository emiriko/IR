This is a pedagogical overview of neutrino physics from the invention of
neutrino by Pauli in 1930 to the precise measurement of neutrino mass and
mixing parameters via neutrino oscillation experiments in recent years. I have
tried to pitch it at the level of undergraduate students, occasionally cutting
corners to avoid the use of advanced mathematical tools. I hope it will be
useful in introducing this exciting field to a broad group of young physicists.
