We study the corner-to-corner resistance of an M x N resistor network with
resistors r and s in the two spatial directions, and obtain an asymptotic
expansion of its exact expression for large M and N. For M = N, r = s =1, our
result is
  R_{NxN} = (4/pi) log N + 0.077318 + 0.266070/N^2 - 0.534779/N^4 + O(1/N^6).
