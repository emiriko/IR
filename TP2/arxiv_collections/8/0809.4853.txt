We discuss how to calculate form factors using a holographic model of QCD,
mainly focusing on vector, axial, and pseudoscalar mesons. We illustrate the
techniques on gravitational form factors (which are useful for constraining the
generalized parton distributions) as well as quoting the results for
electromagnetic form factors. One striking outcome, comparing the several types
of calculated form factors, is that mesons appear noticeably more compact when
measured by the gravitational form factors than when measured by the charge
form factor.
