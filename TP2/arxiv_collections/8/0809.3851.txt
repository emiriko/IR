We present a method to analyze the metal-insulator transition (MIT) due to
the band overlap mechanism. It is based on a model with the knowledge of the
homogeneous electron gas, combined with results based on the quasiparticle
self-consistent $GW$ method. Because of the long-range nature of the Coulomb
interaction, the MIT occurs as the first-order phase transition, that is, the
band gap becomes negative (band overlap) suddenly at some critical lattice
constant.
