We investigate coherent propagation through a large optical density
Tm$^{3+}$:YAG crystal. Using an ultra-stable laser, fiber filtering and site
selection, we investigate the transmitted pulse temporal profile. The plane
wave condition is satisfied by selection of the illuminated spot central area.
We pay special attention to $\pi$-pulse transmission in the prospect of
implementing optical quantum storage protocols.
