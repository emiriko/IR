Here we present an overview of the work done over the years on the embedding
of hypersurfaces in a space of higher dimension, with particular reference to
the embedding of four-dimensional hypersurfaces in five-dimensional
space-times. The concept of embedding was developed by geometers starting from
Gauss. Applications in physics started with the embedding of the Schwarzschild
metric and through the works of Kaluza and Klein. The program on the embedding
of four-dimensional hypersurfaces in five-dimensional spacetimes gathered
strength with the formulation of the induced matter theory by Wesson and his
collaborators. Close on its heels followed the works on the braneworld
scenario. Simultaneously, the mathematical aspects of the embedding of
four-dimensional hypersurfaces in five-dimensional spacetimes were developed as
an application of the Campbell-Magaard theorem. In this paper we have tried to
have a panoramic view of the major works done in these fields and have tried to
focus on the recent trends in this context.
