The resonant circular photogalvanic effect is observed in wurtzite
(0001)-oriented GaN low-dimensional structures excited by infrared radiation.
The current is induced by angular momentum transfer of photons to the
photoexcited electrons at resonant inter-subband optical transitions in a
GaN/AlGaN heterojunction. The signal reverses upon the reversal of the
radiation helicity or, at fixed helicity, when the propagation direction of the
photons is reversed. Making use of the tunability of the free-electron laser
FELIX we demonstrate that the current direction changes by sweeping the photon
energy through the intersubband resonance condition, in agreement with
theoretical considerations.
