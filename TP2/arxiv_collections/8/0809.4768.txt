We present a view of the non-extensive thermodynamics based on general
composition rules. A formal logarithm maps these rules to the addition, which
can be used to generate stationary distributions by standard techniques. We
review the most commonly used rules and as an application we discuss the
Tsallis-Pareto distribution of transverse momenta of energetic hadrons, which
emerge from relativistic heavy-ion collisions.
