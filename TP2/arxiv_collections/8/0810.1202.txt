In the context of Markov processes, both in discrete and continuous setting,
we show a general relation between duality functions and symmetries of the
generator. If the generator can be written in the form of a Hamiltonian of a
quantum spin system, then the "hidden" symmetries are easily derived. We
illustrate our approach in processes of symmetric exclusion type, in which the
symmetry is of SU(2) type, as well as for the Kipnis-Marchioro-Presutti (KMP)
model for which we unveil its SU(1,1) symmetry. The KMP model is in turn an
instantaneous thermalization limit of the energy process associated to a large
family of models of interacting diffusions, which we call Brownian energy
process (BEP) and which all possess the SU(1,1) symmetry. We treat in details
the case where the system is in contact with reservoirs and the dual process
becomes absorbing.
