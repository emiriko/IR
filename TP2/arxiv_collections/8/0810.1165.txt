We theoretically describe the quantum properties of a large Fresnel number
degenerate optical parametric oscillator with spherical mirrors that is pumped
by a Gaussian beam. The resonator is tuned so that the resonance frequency of a
given transverse mode family coincides with the down-converted frequency. After
demonstrating that only the lower orbital angular momentum (OAM) Laguerre-Gauss
modes are amplified above threshold, we focus on the quantum properties of the
rest of (classically empty) modes. We find that combinations of opposite OAM
(Hybrid Laguerre-Gauss modes) can exhibit arbitrary large quadrature squeezing
for the lower OAM non amplified modes.
