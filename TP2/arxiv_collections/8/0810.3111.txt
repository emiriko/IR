We report on radio-frequency measurements of the charge-phase qubit being
under continuous microwave irradiation in the state of weak coupling to a
radio-frequency tank circuit. We studied the rf impedance dependence on the two
important parameters such as power of microwave irradiation whose frequency is
close to the gap between the two lowest qubit energy levels, and temperature of
the internal heat bath. We have found that backaction effects of the qubit on
the rf tank, and vice versa, tank on the qubit, lead to a negative as well as a
positive real part of the qubit impedance Re$Z(\omega)$ seen by the tank. We
have implemented noise spectroscopy measurements for direct impedance readout
at the extreme points corresponding to maximum voltage response and obtained
absolute values of about 0.017 $\Omega$ for the negative and positive
Re$Z(\omega)$. Our results demonstrate the existence and persistence of the
coherent single- and multi-photon Rabi dynamics of the qubit with both negative
and positive dynamic resistance inserted into the tank in the temperature range
of 10 to 200 mK.
