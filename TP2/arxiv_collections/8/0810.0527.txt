We perform the characterization program for the supersymmetric configurations
and solutions of the $\mathcal{N}=1$, $d=5$ Supergravity Theory coupled to an
arbitrary number of vectors, tensors and hypermultiplets and with general
non-Abelian gaugins. By using the conditions yielded by the characterization
program, new exact supersymmetric solutions are found in the $SO(4,1)/SO(4)$
model for the hyperscalars and with $SU(2)\times U(1)$ as the gauge group. The
solutions also content non-trivial vector and massive tensor fields, the latter
being charged under the U(1) sector of the gauge group and with selfdual
spatial components. These solutions are black holes with $AdS_2 \times S^3$
near horizon geometry in the gauged version of the theory and for the ungauged
case we found naked singularities. We also analyze supersymmetric solutions
with only the scalars $\phi^x$ of the vector/tensor multiplets and the metric
as the non-trivial fields. We find that only in the null class the scalars
$\phi^x$ can be non-constant and for the case of constant $\phi^x$ we refine
the classification in terms of the contributions to the scalar potential.
