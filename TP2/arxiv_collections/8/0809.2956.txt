Let $V$ be a finite set of points in the plane. We present a 2-local
algorithm that constructs a plane $\frac{4 \pi \sqrt{3}}{9}$-spanner of the
unit-disk graph $\UDG(V)$. This algorithm makes only one round of communication
and each point of $V$ broadcasts at most 5 messages. This improves the
previously best message-bound of 11 by Ara\'{u}jo and Rodrigues (Fast localized
Delaunay triangulation, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, volume 3544, 2004).
