We have observed the spatial inhomogeneity of the electronic structure of a
single-crystalline electron-doped EuO thin film with ferromagnetic ordering by
employing infrared magneto-optical imaging with synchrotron radiation. The
uniform paramagnetic electronic structure changes to a uniform ferromagnetic
structure via an inhomogeneous state with decreasing temperature and increasing
magnetic field slightly above the ordering temperature. One possibility of the
origin of the inhomogeneity is the appearance of magnetic polaron states.
