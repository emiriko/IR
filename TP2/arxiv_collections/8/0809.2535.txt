We present a numerical study of the order-parameter probability density
function (PDF) of the square Ising model for lattices with linear sizes
$L=80-140$. A recent efficient entropic sampling scheme, combining the
Wang-Landau and broad histogram methods and based on the high-levels of the
Wang-Landau process in dominant energy subspaces is employed. We find that for
large lattices there exists a stable window of the scaled order-parameter in
which the full ansatz including the pre-exponential factor for the tail regime
of the universal PDF is well obeyed. This window is used to estimate the
equation of state exponent and to observe the behavior of the universal
constants implicit in the functional form of the universal PDF. The probability
densities are used to estimate the universal Privman-Fisher coefficient and to
investigate whether one could obtain reliable estimates of the universal
constants controlling the asymptotic behavior of the tail regime.
