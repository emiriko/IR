We consider a family {P} of determinantal point processes arising in
representation theory and random matrix theory. The processes live on the
one-dimensional lattice and their correlation kernels correspond to projection
operators in the l^2 Hilbert space on the lattice. Moreover, these projections
are spectral projections associated to certain selfadjoint second order
difference operators on the lattice. The aim of the note is to demonstrate that
the difference operators in question can be efficiently employed in the study
of limit transitions inside the family {P}.
