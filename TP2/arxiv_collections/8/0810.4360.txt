Motions of fluctuating Brownian particles in an incompressible viscous fluid
have been studied by coupled simulations of Brownian particles and host fluid.
We calculated the velocity autocorrelation functions of Brownian particles and
compared them with the theoretical results. Extensive discussions have been
made on the time scales for which our numerical model is valid.
