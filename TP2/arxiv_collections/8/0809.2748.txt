The resonance states and the decay dynamics of the nonlinear Schr\"odinger
(or Gross-Pitaevskii) equation are studied for a simple, however flexible model
system, the double delta-shell potential. This model allows analytical
solutions and provides insight into the influence of the nonlinearity on the
decay dynamics. The bifurcation scenario of the resonance states is discussed,
as well as their dynamical stability properties. A discrete approximation using
a biorthogonal basis is suggested which allows an accurate description even for
only two basis states in terms of a nonlinear, nonhermitian matrix problem.
