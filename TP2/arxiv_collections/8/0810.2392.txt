The celebration of Allan Kaufman's 80th birthday was an occasion to reflect
on a career that has stimulated the mutual exchange of ideas (or memes in the
terminology of Richard Dawkins) between many researchers. This paper will
revisit a meme Allan encountered in his early career in magnetohydrodynamics,
the continuation of a magnetohydrodynamic mode through a singularity, and will
also mention other problems where Allan's work has had a powerful
cross-fertilizing effect in plasma physics and other areas of physics and
mathematics.
