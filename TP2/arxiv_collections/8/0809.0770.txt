We report a $^{73}$Ge nuclear-quadrupole-resonance (NQR) study on novel
evolution of unconventional superconductivity in antiferromagnetic (AFM)
CeNiGe$_3$. The measurements of the $^{73}$Ge-NQR spectrum and the nuclear
spin-lattice relaxation rate ($1/T_1$) have revealed that the unconventional
superconductivity evolves inside a commensurate AFM phase around the pressure
($P$) where N\'{e}el temperature $T_{\rm N}$ exhibits its maximum at 8.5 K. The
superconducting transition temperature $T_{\rm SC}$ has been found to be
enhanced with increasing $T_{\rm N}$, before reaching the quantum critical
point at which the AFM order collapses. Above $T_{\rm SC}$, the AFM structure
transits from an incommensurate spin-density-wave order to a commensurate AFM
order at $T\sim 2$ K, accompanied by a longitudinal spin-density fluctuation.
With regard to heavy-fermion compounds, these novel phenomena have hitherto
never been reported in the $P$-$T$ phase diagram.
