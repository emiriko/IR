We present simulation details and results for the light hadron spectrum in N
f = 2 + 1 lattice QCD with the nonperturbatively O(a)-improved Wilson quark
action and the Iwasaki gauge action. Simulations are carried out at a lattice
spacing of 0.09 fm on a (2.9fm)^3 box using the PACS-CS computer. We employ the
Luscher's domain-decomposed HMC algorithm with several improvements to reduce
the degenerate up-down quark mass toward the physical value. So far the
resulting pseudoscalar meson mass is ranging from 702MeV down to 156MeV. We
discuss on the stability and the efficiency of the algorithm. The light harden
spectrum extrapolated at the physical point is compared with the experimental
values. We also present the values of the quark masses and the pseudoscalar
meson decay constants.
