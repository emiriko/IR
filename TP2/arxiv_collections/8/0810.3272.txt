Recent advances in nanotechnology and atomic physics may allow for a
demonstration of the dynamical Casimir effect. An array of film bulk acoustic
resonators (FBARs) coherently driven at twice the resonant frequency of a
high-quality electromagnetic cavity can generate a stationary state of Casimir
photons. These are detected using an alkali atom beam prepared in an inverted
population of hyperfine states, with an induced superradiant burst producing a
detectable radio-frequency signal. We describe here the results of the
simulations of the dynamics of superradiance and superfluorescence, with the
aim to optimize the parameters for the detectability of Casimir photons. When
the superradiant lifetime is shorter than the dissipation time, we find
superradiant evolution to be similar in character but dramatically slower than
in the usual lossy case.
