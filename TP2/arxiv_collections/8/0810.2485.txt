This paper thoroughly explores the characteristics of vertical spiral
resonators (VSR). They exhibit rela-tively high Q factors and sizes around a
few percent of the free space wavelength, which make them ideal candi-dates for
assembling metamaterial devices. A quasistatic model of VSR is obtained from
simple analytical ex-pressions, and the effects of certain geometrical
parameters on the resonant frequency are investigated.
