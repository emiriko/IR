Exact analytic solutions and various numerical results for the rewiring of
bipartite networks are discussed. An interpretation in terms of copying and
innovation processes make this relevant in a wide variety of physical contexts.
These include Urn models and Voter models, and our results are also relevant to
some studies of Cultural Transmission, the Minority Game and some models of
ecology.
