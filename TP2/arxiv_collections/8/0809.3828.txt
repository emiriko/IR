A family of integral functionals F which, in a simplified way, model material
microstructure occupying a two-dimensional domain D and which take account of
surface energy and a variable well-depth is studied. It is shown that there is
a critical well-depth, whose scaling with the surface energy density and domain
dimensions is given, below which the state u=0 is the global minimizer of a
typical f in the class F. It is also shown that u=0 is a strict local minimizer
of f in the sense that if a non-zero v is admissible and either its L2 norm or
the meaure of the subset of D where |v_{y}| exceeds 1 is sufficiently small
(with quantitative bounds given in terms of the parameters appearing in the
energy functional f) then f(v) > f(0). Low energy paths between u=0 and the
global minimizer (in the case of a sufficiently large well-depth) are given
such that the cost of introducing small regions where |v_{y}| is larger 1
(analogous to nucleation of martensite in austenite) into the domain D can be
made arbitrarily small.
