Kaluza-Klein modes of fermions in a 5-dimensional toy model are considered.
The number of Kaluza-Klein modes that survive after integration over extra
dimensions is finite in this space. Moreover the extra dimensional piece of the
kinetic term induces no mass for the higher Kaluza-Klein modes on contrary to
the standard lore.
