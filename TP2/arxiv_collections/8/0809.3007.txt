Top-antitop pairs will be copiously produced at the LHC, at a rate of roughly
one per second at a luminosity of10^{33} cm^{-2} s^{-1}. These events have low
background and produce large numbers of jets via the hadronic decay of the W's
which may be used to calibrate the jet energy scale and resolution with
experimental data and simulations.
