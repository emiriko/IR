We investigate the non-Markovian dynamics of two-state systems in structured
reservoirs. We establish a connection between two theoretical quantum
approaches, the pseudomodes [B. M. Garraway, Phys. Rev. A 55, 2290 (1997)] and
the recently developed non-Markovian quantum jump method [J. Piilo et al.,
Phys. Rev. Lett. 100, 180402 (2008)]. This connection provides a clear physical
picture of how the structured reservoir affects the system dynamics, indicating
the role of the pseudomodes as an effective description of the environmental
memory.
