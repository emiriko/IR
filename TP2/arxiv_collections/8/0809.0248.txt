We prove pathwise uniqueness for solutions of parabolic stochastic pde's with
multiplicative white noise if the coefficient is H\"older continuous of index
$\gamma>3/4$. The method of proof is an infinite-dimensional version of the
Yamada-Watanabe argument for ordinary stochastic differential equations.
