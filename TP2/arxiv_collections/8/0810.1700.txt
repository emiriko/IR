We present expressions for the coefficients which arise in asymptotic
expansions of multiple integrals of Laplace type (the first term of which is
known as Laplace's approximation) in terms of asymptotic series of the
functions in the integrand. Our most general result assumes no smoothness of
the functions of the integrand, but the expressions we obtain contain integrals
which may be difficult to evaluate in practice. We then make additional
assumptions which are sufficient to simplify these integrals, in some cases
obtaining explicit formulae for the coefficients in the asymptotic expansions.
