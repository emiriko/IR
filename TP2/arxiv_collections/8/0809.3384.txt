This paper demonstrates that any general 3-DOF three-legged planar parallel
robot with extensible legs can change assembly modes without passing through
parallel singularities (configurations where the mobile platform loses its
stiffness). While the results are purely theoretical, this paper questions the
very definition of parallel singularities.
