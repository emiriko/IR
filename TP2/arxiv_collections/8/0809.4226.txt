We report on the observation of Bragg scattering of an ultracold Fermi gas of
6Li atoms at a dynamic optical potential. The momentum states produced in this
way oscillate in the trap for time scales on the order of seconds, nearly
unperturbed by collisions, which are absent for ultracold fermions due to the
Pauli principle. In contrast, interactions in a mixture with 87Rb atoms lead to
rapid damping. The coherence of these states is demonstrated by Ramsey-type
matter wave interferometry. The signal is improved using an echo pulse
sequence, allowing us to observe coherence times longer than 100 mus. Finally
we use Bragg spectroscopy to measure the in-situ momentum distribution of the
6Li cloud. Signatures for the degeneracy of the Fermi gas can be observed
directly from the momentum distribution of the atoms inside the trap.
