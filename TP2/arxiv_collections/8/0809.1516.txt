Using integration by parts on Gaussian space we construct a Stein Unbiased
Risk Estimator (SURE) for the drift of Gaussian processes using their local and
occupation times. By almost-sure minimization of the SURE risk of shrinkage
estimators we derive an estimation and de-noising procedure for an input signal
perturbed by a continuous-time Gaussian noise.
