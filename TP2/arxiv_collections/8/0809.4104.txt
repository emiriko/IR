By using topological current theory, we study the inner topological structure
of the topological defects in two-dimensional (2D) crystal. We find that there
are two elementary point defects topological current in two-dimensional
crystal, one for dislocations and the other for disclinations. The topological
quantization and evolution of topological defects in two-dimensional crystals
are discussed. Finally, We compare our theory with Brownian-dynamics
simulations in 2D Yukawa systems.
