It is proposed that $T$ violation in hadronic physics, as well as the masses
of $u, d$ quarks, arise from a pseudoscalar interaction with a new spin 0 field
$\tau(x)$, odd in $P$ and $T$, but even in $C$. This interaction contains a
factor $i\gamma_5$ in the quark Dirac algebra, so that the full Hamiltonian is
$P$, $T$ conserving; but by spontaneous symmetry breaking, the new field
$\tau(x)$ has a nonzero expectation value $<\tau>=\tau_0$ that breaks $P$ and
$T$ symmetry.
  Oscillations of $\tau(x)$ about its expectation value $\tau_0$ produce a new
particle, the "timeon", whose mass is independent of any known quantities. If
the timeon mass is within the range of present accelerators, observation of the
particle can be helped with a search of $T$-violating events.}
