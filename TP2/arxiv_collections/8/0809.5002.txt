Asymptotics of solutions to Schroedinger equations with singular magnetic and
electric potentials is investigated. By using a Almgren type monotonicity
formula, separation of variables, and an iterative Brezis-Kato type procedure,
we describe the exact behavior near the singularity of solutions to linear and
semilinear (critical and subcritical) elliptic equations with an inverse square
electric potential and a singular magnetic potential with a homogeneity of
order -1.
