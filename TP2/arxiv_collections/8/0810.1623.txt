We perform non-equilibrium simulations to study heat conduction in
two-dimensional strongly coupled dusty plasmas. Temperature gradients are
established by heating one part of the otherwise equilibrium system to a higher
temperature. Heat conductivity is measured directly from the stationary
temperature profile and heat flux. Particular attention is paid to the
influence of damping effect on the heat conduction. It is found that the heat
conductivity increases with the decrease of the damping rate, while its
magnitude agrees with previous experimental measurement.
