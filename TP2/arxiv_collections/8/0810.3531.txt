We examine possibilities of pion condensation with zero momentum (s-wave
condensation) in neutron stars by using the pion-nucleus optical potential U
and the relativistic mean field (RMF) models. We use low-density
phenomenological optical potentials parameterized to fit deeply bound pionic
atoms or pion-nucleus elastic scatterings. Proton fraction (Y_p) and electron
chemical potential (mu_e) in neutron star matter are evaluated in RMF models.
We find that the s-wave pion condensation hardly takes place in neutron stars
and especially has no chance if hyperons appear in neutron star matter and/or
b_1 parameter in U has density dependence.
