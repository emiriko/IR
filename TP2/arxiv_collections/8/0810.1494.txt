We numerically study the quantum Hall effect (QHE) in bilayer graphene based
on tight-binding model in the presence of disorder. Two distinct QHE regimes
are identified in the full energy band separated by a critical region with
non-quantized Hall Effect. The Hall conductivity around the band center (Dirac
point) shows an anomalous quantization proportional to the valley degeneracy,
but the $\nu=0$ plateau is markedly absent, which is in agreement with
experimental observation. In the presence of disorder, the Hall plateaus can be
destroyed through the float-up of extended levels toward the band center and
higher plateaus disappear first. The central two plateaus around the band
center are most robust against disorder scattering, which is separated by a
small critical region in between near the Dirac point. The longitudinal
conductance around the Dirac point is shown to be nearly a constant in a range
of disorder strength, till the last two QHE plateaus completely collapse.
