We consider whether two copies of a noisy entangled state can be transformed
into a single copy of greater purity using local operations and classical
communication. We show that it is never possible to achieve such a purification
with certainty when the family of noisy states is twirlable (i.e. when there
exists a local transformation that maps all states into the family, yet leaves
the family itself invariant). This implies that two copies of a Werner state
cannot be deterministically purified. Furthermore, due to the construction of
the proof, it will hold not only in quantum theory, but in any generalised
probabilistic theory. We use this to show that two copies of a noisy PR-box (a
hypothetical device more non-local than is allowed by quantum theory) cannot be
purified.
