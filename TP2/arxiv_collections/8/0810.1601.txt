We experiment with injecting a continuous stream of gas into a shallow
liquid, similar to how one might blow into a straw placed at the bottom of a
near-empty drink. By varying the angle of the straw (here a metal needle), we
observe a variety of dynamics, which we film using a high-speed camera. Most
noteworthy is an intermediate regime in which cyclical jets erupt from the
air-liquid interface and breakup into air-born droplets. These droplets trace
out a parabolic trajectory and bounce on the air-liquid interface before
eventually coalescing. The shape of each jet, as well as the time between jets,
is remarkably similar and leads to droplets with nearly identical trajectories.

the Gallery of Fluid Motion in 2008.
