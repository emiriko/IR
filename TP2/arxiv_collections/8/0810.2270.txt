We initiate the study of reducts of relational structures up to primitive
positive interdefinability: After providing the tools for such a study, we
apply these tools in order to obtain a classification of the reducts of the
logic of equality. It turns out that there exists a continuum of such reducts.
Equivalently, expressed in the language of universal algebra, we classify those
locally closed clones over a countable domain which contain all permutations of
the domain.
