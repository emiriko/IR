Stochastic quantisation is applied to the problem of calculating real-time
evolution on a Minkowskian space-time lattice. We employ optimized updating
using reweighting, or gauge fixing, respectively. These procedures do not
affect the underlying theory, but strongly improve the stability properties of
the stochastic dynamics.
