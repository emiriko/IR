Cryogenic bolometers, with their excellent energy resolution, flexibility in
material, and availability in high purity, are excellent detectors for the
search for neutrinoless double beta decay. Kilogram-size single crystals of
TeO_2 are utilized in CUORICINO for an array with a total detector mass of 40.7
kg. CUORICINO currently sets the most stringent limit on the halflife of Te-130
of T > 2.4x10^{24} yr (90% C.L.), corresponding to a limit on the effective
Majorana neutrino mass in the range of < 0.2-0.9 eV. Based on technology
developed for CUORICINO and its predecessors, CUORE is a next-generation
experiment designed to probe neutrino mass in the range of 10 - 100 meV. Latest
results from CUORICINO and overview of the progress and current status of CUORE
are presented.
