The interference of polariton guiding modes propagating through "traffic
circle" waveguides composed of dielectric spherical particles is investigated.
The dependence of intensity of the wave on the position of the particle was
studied using the multisphere the Mie scattering formalism. We show that if the
frequency of light belongs to the passband of the waveguide, electromagnetic
waves may be considered as two optical beams running along a circle in opposite
directions and interfering with each other. Indeed, the obtained intensity
behavior can be represented as a simple superposition of two waves propagating
around a circle in opposite directions. The applications of this interference
are discussed.
