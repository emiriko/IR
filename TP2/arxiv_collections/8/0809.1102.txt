We define tropical Psi-classes on the moduli space of rational tropical
curves in R^2 and consider intersection products of Psi-classes and pull-backs
of evaluations on this space. We show a certain WDVV equation which is
sufficient to prove that tropical numbers of curves satisfying certain Psi- and
evaluation conditions are equal to the corresponding classical numbers. We
present an algorithm that generalizes Mikhalkin's lattice path algorithm and
counts rational plane tropical curves satisfying certain Psi- and evaluation
conditions.
