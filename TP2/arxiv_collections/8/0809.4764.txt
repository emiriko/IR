The notion of generalised exponential family is considered in the restricted
context of nonextensive statistical physics. Examples are given of models
belonging to this family. In particular, the q-Gaussians are discussed and it
is shown that the configurational probability distributions of the
microcanonical ensemble belong to the q-exponential family.
