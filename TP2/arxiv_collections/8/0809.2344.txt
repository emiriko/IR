It is well established that the phase transition between survival and
extinction in spreading models with short-range interactions is generically
associated with the directed percolation (DP) universality class. In many
realistic spreading processes, however, interactions are long ranged and well
described by L\'{e}vy-flights, i.e., by a probability distribution that decays
in $d$ dimensions with distance $r$ as $r^{-d-\sigma}$. We employ the powerful
methods of renormalized field theory to study DP with such long range,
L\'{e}vy-flight spreading in some depth. Our results unambiguously corroborate
earlier findings that there are four renormalization group fixed points
corresponding to, respectively, short-range Gaussian, L\'{e}vy Gaussian,
short-range DP and L\'{e}vy DP, and that there are four lines in the $(\sigma,
d)$ plane which separate the stability regions of these fixed points. When the
stability line between short-range DP and L\'{e}vy DP is crossed, all critical
exponents change continuously. We calculate the exponents describing L\'{e}vy
DP to second order in $\epsilon$-expansion, and we compare our analytical
results to the results of existing numerical simulations. Furthermore, we
calculate the leading logarithmic corrections for several dynamical
observables.
