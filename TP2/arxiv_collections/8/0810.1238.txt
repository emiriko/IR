A well known result of Da Rios and Levi-Civita says that a closed planar
curve is elastic if and only if it is stationary under the localized induction
(or smoke ring) equation, where stationary means that the evolution under the
localized induction equation is by rigid motions. We prove an analogous result
for surfaces: an immersion of a torus into the conformal 3-sphere has constant
mean curvature with respect to a space form subgeometry if and only if it is
stationary under the Davey-Stewartson flow.
