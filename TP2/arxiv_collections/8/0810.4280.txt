The thermopower S of the high-Tc superconductor La(1.6-x)Nd(0.4)Sr(x)CuO(4)
was measured as a function of temperature T near its pseudogap critical point,
the critical hole doping p* where the pseudogap temperature T* goes to zero.
Just above p*, S/T varies as ln(1/T) over a decade of temperature. Below p*,
S/T undergoes a large increase below T*. As with the temperature dependence of
the resistivity, which is linear just above p* and undergoes a large upturn
below T*, these are typical signatures of a quantum phase transition. This
suggests that p* is a quantum critical point below which some order sets in,
causing a reconstruction of the Fermi surface, whose fluctuations are
presumably responsible for the linear-T resistivity and logarithmic
thermopower. We discuss the possibility that this order is the "stripe" order
known to exist in this material.
