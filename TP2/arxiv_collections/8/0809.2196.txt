We obtain quantitative measurements of the oscillation amplitude of vibrating
objects by using sideband digital holography. The frequency sidebands on the
light scattered by the object, shifted by n times the vibration frequency, are
selectively detected by heterodyne holography, and images of the object are
calculated for different orders n. Orders up to n=120 have been observed,
allowing the measurement of amplitudes of oscillation that are significantly
larger than the optical wavelength. Using the positions of the zeros of
intensity for each value of n, we reconstruct the shape of vibration the
object.
