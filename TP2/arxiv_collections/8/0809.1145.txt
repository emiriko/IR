In this article, we calculate the strong coupling constant $g$ among the
decuplet baryons, the octet baryons and the pseudoscalar mesons in the heavy
baryon chiral perturbation theory with the light-cone QCD sum rules, and study
the strong decays $\Sigma^* \to \Lambda \pi,\Sigma \pi$. The numerical value of
the strong coupling constant $g$ is consistent with our previous calculation,
the central values lead to small SU(3) breaking effects, less than 6%; and no
definitive conclusion can be drawn due to the large uncertainties.
