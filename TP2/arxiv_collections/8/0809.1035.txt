We investigate the process of biopolymer translocation through a narrow pore
using a multiscale approach which explicitly accounts for the hydrodynamic
interactions of the molecule with the surrounding solvent. The simulations
confirm that the coupling of the correlated molecular motion to hydrodynamics
results in significant acceleration of the translocation process. Based on
these results, we construct a phenomenological model which incorporates the
statistical and dynamical features of the translocation process and predicts a
power law dependence of the translocation time on the polymer length with an
exponent $\alpha$ $\approx 1.2$. The actual value of the exponent from the
simulations is $\alpha = 1.28 \pm 0.01$, which is in excellent agreement with
experimental measurements of DNA translocation through a nanopore, and is not
sensitive to the choice of parameters in the simulation. The mechanism behind
the emergence of such a robust exponent is related to the interplay between the
longitudinal and transversal dynamics of both translocated and untranslocated
segments. The connection to the macroscopic picture involves separating the
contributions from the blob shrinking and shifting processes, which are both
essential to the translocation dynamics.
