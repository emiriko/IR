There have been many articles and mishaps published about the risks of
uncontrolled spreadsheets in today's business environment, including
non-compliance, operational risk, errors, and fraud all leading to significant
loss events. Spreadsheets fall into the realm of end user developed
applications and are often absent the proper safeguards and controls an IT
organization would enforce for enterprise applications. There is also an
overall lack of software programming discipline enforced in how spreadsheets
are developed. However, before an organization can apply proper controls and
discipline to critical spreadsheets, an accurate and living inventory of
spreadsheets across the enterprise must be created, and all critical
spreadsheets must be identified. As such, this paper proposes an automated
approach to the initial stages of the spreadsheet management lifecycle -
discovery, inventory and risk assessment. Without the use of technology, these
phases are often treated as a one-off project. By leveraging technology, they
become a sustainable business process.
