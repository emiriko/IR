This paper deals with the long run average continuous control problem of
piecewise deterministic Markov processes (PDMP's) taking values in a general
Borel space and with compact action space depending on the state variable. The
control variable acts on the jump rate and transition measure of the PDMP, and
the running and boundary costs are assumed to be positive but not necessarily
bounded. Our first main result is to obtain an optimality equation for the long
run average cost in terms of a discrete-time optimality equation related to the
embedded Markov chain given by the post-jump location of the PDMP. Our second
main result guarantees the existence of a feedback measurable selector for the
discrete-time optimality equation by establishing a connection between this
equation and an integro-differential equation. Our final main result is to
obtain some sufficient conditions for the existence of a solution for a
discrete-time optimality inequality and an ordinary optimal feedback control
for the long run average cost using the so-called vanishing discount approach.
