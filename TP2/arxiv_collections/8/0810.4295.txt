The thermal properties of cold dense nuclear matter are investigated with
chiral perturbation theory.
  The evolution curves for the baryon number density, baryon number
susceptibility, pressure and the equation of state are obtained.
  The chiral condensate is calculated and our result shows that when the baryon
chemical potential goes beyond $1150 \mathrm{MeV}$, the absolute value of the
quark condensate decreases rapidly, which indicates a tendency of chiral
restoration.
