The presence of first sharp diffraction peaks in the partial structure
factors is investigated in computer simulations of molten mixtures of alkali
halides. An intermediate range ordering appears for the Li+ ions only, which is
associated with clustering of this species and is not reflected in the
arrangement of other ions. This ordering is surprising in view of the
simplicity of the interionic interactions in alkali halides. The clustering
reflects an incomplete mixing of the various species on a local length scale,
which can be demonstrated by studying the complementary sub-space of cations in
the corresponding pure alkali halides by means of a void analysis.
