The paradigm for singular continuous spectra in symbolic dynamics and in
mathematical diffraction is provided by the Thue-Morse chain, in its
realisation as a binary sequence with values in $\{\pm 1\}$. We revisit this
example and derive a functional equation together with an explicit form of the
corresponding singular continuous diffraction measure, which is related to the
known representation as a Riesz product.
