We consider the minimal supergravity model (mSUGRA) with one additional
R-parity violating operator at the GUT scale. The superparticles mass spectra
at the weak scale are generally altered due to the presence of the R-parity
violating coupling in the renormalization group equations. We show that a
lepton number violating coupling at the GUT scale can lead to a sneutrino as
the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) in a large region of parameter space
consistent with the muon anomalous magnetic moment and other precision
measurements. We also give characteristic collider signatures at the LHC.
