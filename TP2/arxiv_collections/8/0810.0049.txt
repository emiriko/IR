Our ab initio calculations of CO adsorption energies on low miller index
(111), (100), stepped (211), and kinked (532) gold surfaces show a strong
dependence on local coordination with a reduction in Au atom coordination
leading to higher binding energies. We find trends in adsorption energies to be
similar to those reported in experiments and calculations for other metal
surfaces. The (532) surface provides insights into these trends because of the
availability of a large number of kink sites which naturally have the lowest
coordination (6). We also find that, for all surfaces, an increase in CO
coverage triggers a decrease in the adsorption energy. Changes in the
work-function upon CO adsorption, as well as the frequencies of the CO
vibrational modes are calculated, and their coverage dependence is reported.
