I look at the 'flavour-oscillation clocks' proposed by D.V. Ahluwalia, and
two arguments of his suggesting that such clocks might behave in a way that
threatens the geometricity of general relativity (GR). The first argument
states that the behaviour of these clocks in the vicinity of a rotating
gravitational source implies a non-geometric element of gravity. I argue that
the phenomenon is best seen as an instance of violation of the 'clock
hypothesis', and therefore does not threaten the geometrical nature of
gravitation. Ahluwalia's second argument, for the 'incompleteness' of general
relativity, involves the idea that flavour-oscillation clocks can detect
constant gravitational potentials. I argue that the purported
'incompleteness-establishing' result is in fact one that applies to all clocks.
It is entirely derivable from GR, does not result in the observability of the
potential, and is not at odds with any of GR's foundations.
