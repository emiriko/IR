We study a family of memory-based persistent random walks and we prove weak
convergences after space-time rescaling. The limit processes are not only
Brownian motions with drift. We have obtained a continuous but non-Markov
process $(Z_t)$ which can be easely expressed in terms of a counting process
$(N_t)$. In a particular case the counting process is a Poisson process, and
$(Z_t)$ permits to represent the solution of the telegraph equation. We study
in detail the Markov process $((Z_t,N_t); t\ge 0)$.
