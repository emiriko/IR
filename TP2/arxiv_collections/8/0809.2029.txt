The electron spin g- and hyperfine tensors of the endohedral metallofullerene
Sc@C82 are anisotropic. Using electron spin resonance (ESR) and density
functional theory (DFT), we can relate their principal axes to the coordinate
frame of the molecule, finding that the g-tensor is not axially symmetric. The
Sc bond with the cage is partly covalent and partly ionic. Most of the electron
spin density is distributed around the carbon cage, but 5% is associated with
the scandium d_yz orbital, and this drives the observed anisotropy.
