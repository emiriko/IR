New studies of the ATLAS and CMS collaborations are presented on the
sensitivity to searches for non-standard signatures of particular SUSY
scenarios. These signatures include non-pointing photons, as well as pairs of
prompt photons, as expected in GMSB SUSY models, as well as heavy stable
charged particles produced in split supersymmetry models, long lived staus from
GMSB SUSY and long lived stops in other SUSY scenarios. A detailed detector
simulation is used for the study, and all relevant Standard Model backgrounds
and detector effects that can mimic these special signatures are included. It
is shown that already with less than 100 pb$^{-1}$ the ATLAS and CMS
sensitivity will probe an interesting as yet by data unexplored parameter range
of these models.
