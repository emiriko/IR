The first Pb-Pb collisions at the LHC are little more than a year away. This
paper discusses some of the exciting measurements which the experiments will be
able to perform in the very first run, even with modest luminosity, and gives a
very short overview of some of the most interesting ones attainable with more
extended runs. The dedicated Heavy-Ion experiment ALICE, but also ATLAS and
CMS, experiments optimized for p-p collisions, are ready and eager to make best
use of the nuclear beams in the LHC as soon as they will be available. The main
specificities of the three detectors for Heavy-Ion collisions will also be
briefly addressed in this paper. I will try to show that already the first
results obtainable with Heavy-Ion beams at the LHC will qualify it as a
discovery machine, capable to provide fundamental new insight to our knowledge
of high-density QCD matter.
