Recent scanning tunneling microscopy studies have shown that local nanoscale
pairing inhomogenities are correlated with interstitial oxygen dopants in
Bi-2212. Combining electrostatic and cluster calculations, in this paper the
impact of a dopant on the local Madelung and charge transfer energies, magnetic
exchange J, Zhang-Rice mobility, and interactions with the lattice is
investigated. It is found that electrostatic modifications locally increases
the charge transfer energy and slightly suppresses J. It is further shown that
coupling to c-axis phonons is strongly modified near the dopant. The combined
effects of electrostatic modifications and coupling to the lattice yield
broadened spectral features, reduced charge gap energies, and a sizable local
increase of J. This implies a strong local interplay between
antiferromagnetism, polarons, and superconducting pairing.
