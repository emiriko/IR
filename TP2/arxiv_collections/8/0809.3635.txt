The existence of an internal frequency associated to any elementary particle
conjectured by de Broglie is compared with a classical description of the
electron, where this internal structure corresponds to the motion of the centre
of charge around the centre of mass of the particle. This internal motion has a
frequency twice de Broglie's frequency, which corresponds to the frequency
found by Dirac when analysing the electron structure. To get evidence of this
internal electron clock a kind of experiment as the one performed by Gouan\'ere
et al. \cite{Gouanere} will show a discrete set of momenta at which a resonant
scattering effect, appears. The resonant momenta of the electron beam are given
by $p_k=161.748/k$ MeV$/c$, $k=1,2,3,...$, where only, the corresponding to
$k=2$, was within the range of Gouan\'ere et al. experiment. The extension of
the experiment to other values of $p_k$, would show the existence of this
phenomenon.
