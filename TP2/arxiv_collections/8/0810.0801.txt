The energy of a simple graph $G$ arising in chemical physics, denoted by
$\mathcal E(G)$, is defined as the sum of the absolute values of eigenvalues of
$G$. We consider the asymptotic energy per vertex (say asymptotic energy) for
lattice systems. In general for a type of lattice in statistical physics, to
compute the asymptotic energy with toroidal, cylindrical, Mobius-band,
Klein-bottle, and free boundary conditions are different tasks with different
hardness. In this paper, we show that if $\{G_n\}$ is a sequence of finite
simple graphs with bounded average degree and $\{G_n'\}$ a sequence of spanning
subgraphs of $\{G_n\}$ such that almost all vertices of $G_n$ and $G_n'$ have
the same degrees, then $G_n$ and $G_n'$ have the same asymptotic energy. Thus,
for each type of lattices with toroidal, cylindrical, Mobius-band,
Klein-bottle, and free boundary conditions, we have the same asymptotic energy.
As applications, we obtain the asymptotic formulae of energies per vertex of
the triangular, $3^3.4^2$, and hexagonal lattices with toroidal, cylindrical,
Mobius-band, Klein-bottle, and free boundary conditions simultaneously.
