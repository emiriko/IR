The primary purpose of this paper is give a classification scheme for the
nonzero primes of a Pr\"ufer domain based on five properties. A prime $P$ of a
Pr\"ufer domain $R$ could be sharp or not sharp, antesharp or not, divisorial
or not, branched or unbranched, idempotent or not. Based on these five basic
properties, there are six types of maximal ideals and twelve types of
nonmaximal (nonzero) primes. Both characterizations and examples are given for
each type that exists.
