Current predictions for the ratio of phi -> K^+K^-/K_LK_S decay rates exceed
the corresponding experimental value in about five standard deviations. By far,
the dominant sources of isospin breaking to this ratio are the phase-space
(52%) and the electromagnetic radiative (4.3%, computed within scalar QED)
corrections. Here we estimate the effects of the electromagnetic structure of
kaons and other model-dependent contributions into the radiative corrections.
