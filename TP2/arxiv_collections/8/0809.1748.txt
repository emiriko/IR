In this master thesis the possible supersymmetric phenomenologies associated
with low-mass mSUGRA are investigated. The main characteristics of the
supersymmetric mass spectrum are explained and a systematic method is presented
to predict phenomenology directly from the mass spectrum. The resulting
phenomenologies are compared to the current ATLAS benchmark points. It is found
that some phenomenological scenarios are not covered by these benchmark points.
