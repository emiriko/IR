Unbounded stochastic control problems may lead to Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman
equations whose Hamiltonians are not always defined, especially when the
diffusion term is unbounded with respect to the control. We obtain existence
and uniqueness of viscosity solutions growing at most like $o(1+|x|^p)$ at
infinity for such HJB equations and more generally for degenerate parabolic
equations with a superlinear convex gradient nonlinearity. If the corresponding
control problem has a bounded diffusion with respect to the control, then our
results apply to a larger class of solutions, namely those growing like
$O(1+|x|^p)$ at infinity. This latter case encompasses some equations related
to backward stochastic differential equations.
