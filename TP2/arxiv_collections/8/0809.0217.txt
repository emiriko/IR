We discuss models for massless Dirac fermions being subject to a
perpendicular magnetic field in spherical geometry. These models are analogues
of Haldane`s spherical construction for massful charge carriers. The single
particle states constructed here are easily implemented in existing numerical
code for many-body problems in conventional quantum Hall systems. Moreover, the
many-body states of fully filled sublevels in the subspace of lowest Landau
level index are skyrmions with respect to the layer spin.
