The assisted tunneling of a wave packet between square one dimensional
barriers is treated analytically. The tunneling rate is calculated exactly for
a potential mimicking a constant electric field with arbitrary time dependence.
The pole spectrum of the barriers determines the decay time. The tunneling
probability is enhanced by the perturbation. The results are exemplified for a
simplified model of nuclear $\ds \alpha$ decay.
