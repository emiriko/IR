We demonstrate how the matrix-product state formalism provides a flexible
structure to solve the constrained optimization problem associated with the
sequential generation of entangled multiqubit states under experimental
restrictions. We consider a realistic scenario in which an ancillary system
with a limited number of levels performs restricted sequential interactions
with qubits in a row. The proposed method relies on a suitable local
optimization procedure, yielding an efficient recipe for the realistic and
approximate sequential generation of any entangled multiqubit state. We give
paradigmatic examples that may be of interest for theoretical and experimental
developments.
