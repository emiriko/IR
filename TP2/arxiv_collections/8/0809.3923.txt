We study the excitations of hadrons containing a single heavy quark. We
present meson and baryon mass splittings and ratios of meson decay constants
resulting from quenched and dynamical two-flavor configurations. Light quarks
are simulated using the Chirally Improved (CI) lattice Dirac operator. The
heavy quark is approximated by a static propagator, appropriate for the $b$
quark on our lattices ($1/a \sim 1-2$ GeV). We also include some preliminary
calculations of the heavy-quark kinetic corrections to the states.
