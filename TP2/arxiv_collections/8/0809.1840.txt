The class of dispersion models introduced by J{\o}rgensen (1997b) covers many
known distributions such as the normal, Student t, gamma, inverse Gaussian,
hyperbola, von-Mises, among others. We study the small dispersion asymptotic
(J{\o}rgensen, 1987b) behavior of the probability density functions of
dispersion models which satisfy the uniformly convergent saddlepoint
approximation. Our results extend those obtained by Finner et al. (2008).
