The charge radii of octet-baryons obtained in quenched lattice-QCD
calculations are extrapolated within heavy-baryon chiral perturbation theory.
Finite-range regularization (FRR) is applied to improve the convergence of the
chiral expansion and to provide estimates of quenching artifacts. Lattice
values of quark distribution radii and baryon charge radii for $\mpi^2$ in the
range (0.1, 0.7)$\gev^2$ are described very well with FRR. Upon estimating
corrections for both finite-volume and quenching effects, the obtained charge
radii of the proton, neutron and $\Sigma^-$ are in good agreement with
experimental measurements. The predicted charge radii of the remaining
octet-baryons have not yet been measured and present a challenge to future
experiments.
