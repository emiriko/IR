A selection of exclusive SUSY measurements is presented which can be
performed provided SUSY will be discovered at the LHC. Such measurements allow
to determine the properties of supersymmetry and thus help to pin down the
underlying theoretical model. It is described on an mSUGRA example point how
sparticle masses can be reconstructed from endpoints in mass spectra using
early LHC data. Finally it is shown how well mSUGRA model parameters can be
derived from these measurements.
