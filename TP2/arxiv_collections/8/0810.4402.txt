Let G be a connected Lie group, LG its loop group, and PG->G the principal
LG-bundle defined by quasi-periodic paths in G. This paper is devoted to
differential geometry of the Atiyah algebroid A=T(PG)/LG of this bundle. Given
a symmetric bilinear form on the Lie algebra g and the corresponding central
extension of Lg, we consider the lifting problem for A, and show how the
cohomology class of the Cartan 3-form on G arises as an obstruction. This
involves the construction of a 2-form on PG with differential the pull-back of
the Cartan form. In the second part of this paper we obtain similar
LG-invariant primitives for the higher degree analogues of the Cartan form, and
for their G-equivariant extensions.
