We review several most recent prompt-photon measurements at HERA and the
Tevatron and discuss their implication for future measurements at the LHC. A
comparison to Monte Carlo models, as well as to NLO QCD predictions based on
the standard DGLAP and the kT-factorization approaches is discussed. Effects
from renormalization and factorization scale uncertainties, as well as
uncertainties on the gluon density distribution inside a proton are discussed.
