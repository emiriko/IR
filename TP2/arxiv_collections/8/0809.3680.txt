An approximate many-body theory incorporating two-body correlations has been
employed to calculate low-lying collective multipole frequencies in a
Bose-Einstein condensate containing $A$ bosons, for different values of the
interaction parameter $\lambda=\frac{Aa_{s}}{a_{ho}}$. Significant difference
from the variational estimate of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation has been found
near the collapse region. This is attributed to two-body correlations and
finite range attraction of the realistic interatomic interaction. A large
deviation from the hydrodynamic model is also seen for the second monopole
breathing mode and the quadrupole mode for large positive $\lambda$.
