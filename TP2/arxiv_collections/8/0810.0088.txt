Kirillov-Reshetikhin and Levendorskii-Soibelman developed a formula for the
universal R-matrix of the form R=(X^{-1} \otimes X^{-1}) \Delta(X). The action
of X on a representation V permutes weight spaces according to the longest
element in the Weyl group, so is only defined in finite type. We give a similar
formula which is valid for the quantized universal enveloping algebra of any
symmetrizable Kac-Moody algebra. This is done by replacing the action of X on V
with an endomorphism that preserves weight spaces, but which is bar-linear
instead of linear.
