The electrical resistivity (Rxx) and Hall resistivity (Rxy) of LaFeAsO1-xFx
have been measured over a wide fluorine doping range 0 =< x =< 0.14 using 60 T
pulsed magnets. While the superconducting phase diagram (Tc, x) displays the
classic dome-shaped structure, we find that the resistive upper critical field
(Hc2) increases monotonically with decreasing fluorine concentration, with the
largest Hc2 >= 75 T for x = 0.05. This is reminiscent of the composition
dependence in high-Tc cuprates and might correlate with opening of a pseudo-gap
in the underdoped region. Further, the temperature dependence of Hc2(T) for
superconducting samples can be understood in terms of multi-band
superconductivity. Rxy data for non-superconducting samples show non-linear
field dependence, which is also consistent with a multi-carrier scenario.
