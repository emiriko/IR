We present a very simple model of the radius stabilization in a
supersymmetric (SUSY) Randall-Sundrum model with a hypermultiplet and a
boundary constant superpotential. A wide range of parameters where the anomaly
mediation of SUSY breaking is dominated is found although there are many
problematic bulk effects of SUSY breaking. A negative cosmological constant in
the radius stabilized vacuum can be cancelled by a localized SUSY breaking.
Making use of this localized SUSY breaking also solves the \mu-problem by
Giudice-Masiero mechanism.
