We propose a general approach to study spin models with two symmetric
absorbing states. Starting from the microscopic dynamics on a square lattice,
we derive a Langevin equation for the time evolution of the magnetization
field, that successfully explains coarsening properties of a wide range of
nonlinear voter models and systems with intermediate states. We find that the
macroscopic behavior only depends on the first derivatives of the spin-flip
probabilities. Moreover, an analysis of the mean-field term reveals the three
types of transitions commonly observed in these systems -generalized voter,
Ising and directed percolation-. Monte Carlo simulations of the spin dynamics
qualitatively agree with theoretical predictions.
