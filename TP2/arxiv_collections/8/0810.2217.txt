Strongly correlated states in many-body systems are traditionally created
using elastic interparticle interactions. Here we show that inelastic
interactions between particles can also drive a system into the strongly
correlated regime. This is shown by an experimental realization of a specific
strongly correlated system, namely a one-dimensional molecular Tonks-Girardeau
gas.
