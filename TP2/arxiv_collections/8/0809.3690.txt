Black box models of technical systems are purely descriptive. They do not
explain why a system works the way it does. Thus, black box models are
insufficient for some problems. But there are numerous applications, for
example, in control engineering, for which a black box model is absolutely
sufficient. In this article, we describe a general stochastic framework with
which such models can be built easily and fully automated by observation.
Furthermore, we give a practical example and show how this framework can be
used to model and control a motorcar powertrain.
