We present a fabrication method producing large and flat graphene flakes that
have a few layers down to a single layer based on substrate bonding of a thick
sample of highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG), followed by its controlled
exfoliation down to the few to single graphene atomic layers. As the graphite
underlayer is intimately bonded to the substrate during the exfoliation
process, the obtained graphene flakes are remarkably large and flat and present
very few folds and pleats. The high occurrence of single layered graphene
sheets having tens of micron wide in lateral dimensions is assessed by
complementary probes including spatially resolved Micro-Raman Spectroscopy,
Atomic Force Microscopy and Electrostatic Force Microscopy. This versatile
method opens the way of deposition of graphene on any substrates including
flexible ones.
