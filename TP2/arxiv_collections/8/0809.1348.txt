We propose the application of multiple-bases belief-propagation, an optimized
iterative decoding method, to a set of rate-1/2 LDPC codes from the IEEE
802.16e WiMAX standard. The presented approach allows for improved decoding
performance when signaling over the AWGN channel. As all required operations
for this method can be run in parallel, the decoding delay of this method and
standard belief-propagation decoding are equal. The obtained results are
compared to the performance of LDPC codes optimized with the progressive
edge-growth algorithm and to bounds from information theory. It will be shown
that the discussed method mitigates the gap to the well-known random coding
bound by about 20 percent.
