The key aspects of a gauge-invariant Lagrangian description of massive and
massless half-integer higher-spin fields in AdS spaces with a two-row Young
tableaux $Y(s_1,s_2)$ are presented in an unconstrained description, as well as
in off-shell formulations with algebraic constraints, on the basis of BFV-BRST
operators for non-linear operator superalgebras, encoding the initial
conditions realized by constraints in a Fock space and extracting the
higher-spin fields from unitary representations of the AdS group.
