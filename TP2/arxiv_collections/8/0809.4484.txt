The only systems previously known to be resistant to all the standard control
types were highly artificial election systems created by hybridization. We
study a parameterized version of Copeland voting, denoted by Copeland^\alpha,
where the parameter \alpha is a rational number between 0 and 1 that specifies
how ties are valued in the pairwise comparisons of candidates. We prove that
Copeland^{0.5}, the system commonly referred to as "Copeland voting," provides
full resistance to constructive control, and we prove the same for
Copeland^\alpha, for all rational \alpha, 0 < \alpha < 1. Copeland voting is
the first natural election system proven to have full resistance to
constructive control. We also prove that both Copeland^1 (Llull elections) and
Copeland^0 are resistant to all standard types of constructive control other
than one variant of addition of candidates. Moreover, we show that for each
rational \alpha, 0 \leq \alpha \leq 1, Copeland^\alpha voting is fully
resistant to bribery attacks, and we establish fixed-parameter tractability of
bounded-case control for Copeland^\alpha. We also study Copeland^\alpha
elections under more flexible models such as microbribery and extended control
and we integrate the potential irrationality of voter preferences into many of
our results.
