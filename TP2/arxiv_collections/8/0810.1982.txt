In non-dilute colloidal suspensions, gradients in particle volume fraction
result in gradients in electrical conductivity and permittivity. An externally
applied electric field couples with gradients in electrical conductivity and
permittivity and, under some conditions, can result in electric body forces
that drive the flow unstable forming vortices. The experiments are conducted in
square 200 micron PDMS microfluidic channels. Colloidal suspensions consisted
of 0.01 volume fraction of 2 or 3 micron diameter polystyrene particles in 0.1
mM Phosphate buffer and 409 mM sucrose to match particle-solution density. AC
electric fields at 20 Hz and strength of 430 to 600 V/cm were used. We present
a fluid dynamics video that shows the evolution of the particle aggregation and
formation of vortical flow. Upon application of the field particles aggregate
forming particle chains and three dimensional structures. These particles form
rotating bands where the axis of rotation varies with time and can collide with
other rotating bands forming increasingly larger bands. Some groups become
vortices with a stable axis of rotation. Other phenomena showed include counter
rotating vortices, colliding vortices, and non-rotating particle bands with
internal waves.
