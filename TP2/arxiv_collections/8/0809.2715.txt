We investigate phase transitions for the Walecka model at very high
temperatures. As is well known, depending on the parametrization of this model
and for the particular case of a zero chemical potential ($ \mu $), a first
order phase transition is possible \cite{theis}. We investigate this model for
the case in which $ \mu \ne 0 $. It turns out that, in this situation, phases
with different values of antinucleon-nucleon ratios and net baryon densities
may coexist. We present the temperature versus antinucleon-nucleon ratio as
well as the temperature versus the net baryon density for the coexistence
region. The temperature versus chemical potential phase diagram is also
presented.
