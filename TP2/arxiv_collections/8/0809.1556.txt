We classify biqutrit and triqutrit pure states under stochastic local
operations and classical communication. By investigating the right singular
vector spaces of the coefficient matrices of the states, we obtain explicitly
two equivalent classes of biqutrit states and twelve equivalent classes of
triqutrit states respectively.
