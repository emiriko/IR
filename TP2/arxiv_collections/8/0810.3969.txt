Let $R$ be a noetherian ring, $\fa$ an ideal of $R$ such that $\dim R/\fa=1$
and $M$ a finite $R$--module. We will study cofiniteness and some other
properties of the local cohomology modules $\lc^{i}_{\fa}(M)$. For an arbitrary
ideal $\fa$ and an $R$--module $M$ (not necessarily finite), we will
characterize $\fa$--cofinite artinian local cohomology modules. Certain sets of
coassociated primes of top local cohomology modules over local rings are
characterized.
