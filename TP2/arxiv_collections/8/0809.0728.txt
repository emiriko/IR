A new perspective on cognitive radio is presented, where the pre-existent
legacy service is either uncoded or coded and a pair of cognitive transceivers
need be appropriately deployed to coexist with the legacy service. The basic
idea underlying the new perspective is to exploit the fact that, typically, the
legacy channel is not fully loaded by the legacy service, thus leaving a
non-negligible margin to accommodate the cognitive transmission. The
exploitation of such a load margin is optimized by shaping the spectrum of the
transmitted cognitive signal. It is shown that non-trivial coexistence of
legacy and cognitive systems is possible even without sharing the legacy
message with the cognitive transmitter. Surprisingly, the optimized cognitive
transmitter is no longer limited by its interference power at the legacy
receiver, and can always transmit at its full available device power.
Analytical development and numerical illustration are presented, in particular
focusing on the logarithmic growth rate, {\it i.e.}, the prelog coefficient, of
cognitive transmission in the high-power regime.
