The presence of tau leptons in the final state is an important signature in
many Higgs boson and SUSY searches. With the ATLAS detector, hadronically
decaying tau leptons can be reconstructed in a wide range of transverse
energies. The reconstruction algorithm for hadronically decaying tau leptons is
explained and the performance of tau lepton identification is shown.
Particularly important is the discrimination of hadronically decaying tau
leptons against overwhelming backgrounds from QCD jets.
