We use the adaptive time-dependent density matrix renormalization group
method (t-DMRG) to study the nonequilibrium dynamics of a benchmark quantum
impurity system which has a time-dependent Hamiltonian. This model is a
resonant-level model, obtained by a mapping from a certain Ohmic spin-boson
model describing the dissipative Landau-Zener transition. We map the
resonant-level model onto a Wilson chain, then calculate the time-dependent
occupation $n_d(t)$ of the resonant level. We compare t-DMRG results with exact
results at zero temperature and find very good agreement. We also give a
physical interpretation of the numerical results.
