Ping-Pong protocol is a type of quantum key distribution which makes use of
two entangled photons in the EPR state. Its security is based on the
randomization of the operations that Alice performs on the travel photon
(qubit), and on the anti-correlation between the two photons in the EPR state.
In this paper, we study the security of this protocol against some known
quantum attacks, and present a scheme that may enhance its security to some
degree.
