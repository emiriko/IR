We have measured excitation function for dp -> ppp_pi- reaction near the eta
production threshold. We observe an enhancement of the counting rate above the
threshold which can originate from the production of the eta meson in the
reaction dp -> 3He eta and its subsequent absorption on neutron in the 3He
nucleus leading to creation of the p_pi- pair.
