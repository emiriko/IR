This note collects formulas relative to the energy dependence of the cross
sections for open charm and $J/\psi$ production for $NN$-collisions at
threshold. It is a basis for the best input to MonteCarlo calculations, for
associative charm particle production in nucleon-nucleon, nucleon-nucleus,
ion-ion and proton-antiproton collisions.
