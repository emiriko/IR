We extend the classical formula of Porteous for blowing-up Chern classes to
the case of blow-ups of possibly singular varieties along regularly embedded
centers. The proof of this generalization is perhaps conceptually simpler than
the standard argument for the nonsingular case, involving Riemann-Roch without
denominators. The new approach relies on the explicit computation of an ideal,
and a mild generalization of the well-known formula for the normal bundle of a
proper transform.
  We also discuss alternative, very short proofs of the standard formula in
some cases: an approach relying on the theory of Chern-Schwartz-MacPherson
classes (working in characteristic 0), and an argument reducing the formula to
a straightforward computation of Chern classes for sheaves of differential
1-forms with logarithmic poles (when the center of the blow-up is a complete
intersection).
