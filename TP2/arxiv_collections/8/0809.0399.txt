We describe a simple strontium vapor cell for laser spectroscopy experiments.
Strontium vapor is produced using an electrically heated commercial dispenser
source. The sealed cell operates at room temperature, and without a buffer gas
or vacuum pump. The cell was characterised using laser spectroscopy, and was
found to offer stable and robust operation, with an estimated lifetime of
>10,000 hours. By changing the dispenser, this technique can be readily
extended to other alkali and alkaline earth elements.
