Directional point-contact Andreev-reflection spectroscopy measurements on the
Ba$_{0.55}$K$_{0.45}$Fe$_2$As$_2$ single crystals are presented. The spectra
show significant differences when measured in the $ab$ plane in comparison with
those measured in the $c$ direction of the crystal. In the latter case only a
reduced point-contact conductance around zero bias has been revealed persisting
well above $T_c$ and probably related to the structural and magnetic
transitions in the system. Within the $ab$ plane two superconducting energy
gaps are detected below $T_c$. Here a reduced conductance above $T_c$ could
also be found. The fits of the $ab$-plane data to the superconducting s-wave
two-gap model indicate that the smaller gap has a size below the BCS value
while the large gap reveals much higher coupling strength.
