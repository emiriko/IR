We study a classical multiparticle system (such as Toda lattice) whose
dynamics we intend to control by forces applied to few particles of the system.
Various problem settings, typical for control theory are posed for this model;
among those: studying accessibility and controllability properties, structure
properties and feedback linearization of respective control system,
time-optimal relocation of particles. We obtain complete or partial answers to
the posed questions; criteria and methods of geometric control theory are
employed. In the present part I we consider nonperiodic multiparticle system.
In the forthcoming Part II we address controllability issue for multiparticle
system subject to periodic boundary conditions. That study would require an
extension and refinement of known methods of geometric control.
