An automorphism $\alpha$ of a group $G$ is normal if it fixes every normal
subgroup of $G$ setwise. We give an algebraic description of normal
automorphisms of relatively hyperbolic groups. In particular, we prove that for
any relatively hyperbolic group $G$, $Inn(G)$ has finite index in the subgroup
$Aut_n(G)$ of normal automorphisms. If, in addition, $G$ is non-elementary and
has no non-trivial finite normal subgroups, then $Aut_n(G)=Inn(G)$. As an
application, we show that $Out(G)$ is residually finite for every finitely
generated residually finite group $G$ with more than one end.
