We present a QCD light-cone sum rule (LCSR) estimation of the B -> pi, B ->
K, and Bs -> K form factors calculating gluon radiative corrections at
next-to-leading order. The MS-bar b-quark mass is used, instead of the one-loop
pole mass employed in the previous analyses. For B -> K and Bs -> K form
factors the SU(3)-symmetry breaking corrections are included, both in the
hard-scattering kernels and in the distribution amplitudes (DAs). By combining
the predicted value for f^+_{Bpi}(0) with the product |Vub f^+_{Bpi}| extracted
from the B -> pi l nu measurement, we obtain the LCSR prediction for Vub CKM
matrix element.
