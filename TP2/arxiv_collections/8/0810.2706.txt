The decay B^0 -> DK^{*0} is well-known to provide excellent potential for a
precise measurement of the Unitarity Triangle angle gamma in future
experiments. It is noted that the sensitivity can be significantly enhanced by
studying the amplitudes relative to those of the flavour-specific decay B^0 ->
D_2^{*-}K^+, which can be achieved by analyzing the B^0 -> D\pi^-K^+ Dalitz
plot.
