The spectral densities of ensembles of non-Hermitian sparse random matrices
are analysed using the cavity method. We present a set of equations from which
the spectral density of a given ensemble can be efficiently and exactly
calculated. Within this approach, the generalised Girko's law is recovered
easily. We compare our results with direct diagonalisation for a number of
random matrix ensembles, finding excellent agreement.
