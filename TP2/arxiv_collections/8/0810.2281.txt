Welcome to the 2008 TASI lectures on the exciting topic of `tools and
technicalities' (original title). Technically, LHC physics is really all about
perturbative QCD in signals or backgrounds. Whenever we look for interesting
signatures at the LHC we get killed by QCD. Therefore, I will focus on QCD
issues which arise for example in Higgs searches or exotics searches at the
LHC, and ways to tackle them nowadays. In the last section you will find a few
phenomenological discussions, for example on missing energy or helicity
amplitudes.
