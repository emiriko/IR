We show explicitly that the one- and two-dimensional Hubbard model does not
show phase separation at any filling at T=0. Apart from a single plausible
assumption, only known exact results and symmetry properties for the one-band
Hubbard model are used. Implications for usage of the simple one-band Hubbard
model for analysing the physics of cuprate superconductors are discussed. We
also discuss models where electronic phase separation might generically occur,
in the specific context of colossal magneto-resistance manganites.
