The NA62 experiment, proposed to measure the very rare decay K+ to pi+ nu
nubar at the CERN SPS with 10% accuracy, aims to collect about 80 events in two
years of data taking, keeping background contamination lower than 10%. This
paper describes the status of the project and the perspectives of the
experiment.
