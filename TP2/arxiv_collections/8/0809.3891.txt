We study the adiabatic limit for the sequential passage of atoms through a
high-Q cavity, in the presence of frequency chirps. Despite the fact that the
adiabatic approximation might be expected to fail, we were able to show that
for proper choice of Stark-pulses this is not the case. Instead, a connection
to the resonant limit is established, where the robust creation of entanglement
is demonstrated. Recent developments in the fabrication of high-Q cavities
allow fidelities for a maximally entangled state up to 97%.
