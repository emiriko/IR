We consider the task of testing properties of Boolean functions that are
invariant under linear transformations of the Boolean cube. Previous work in
property testing, including the linearity test and the test for Reed-Muller
codes, has mostly focused on such tasks for linear properties. The one
exception is a test due to Green for "triangle freeness": a function
$f:\cube^{n}\to\cube$ satisfies this property if $f(x),f(y),f(x+y)$ do not all
equal 1, for any pair $x,y\in\cube^{n}$.
  Here we extend this test to a more systematic study of testing for
linear-invariant non-linear properties. We consider properties that are
described by a single forbidden pattern (and its linear transformations), i.e.,
a property is given by $k$ points $v_{1},...,v_{k}\in\cube^{k}$ and
$f:\cube^{n}\to\cube$ satisfies the property that if for all linear maps
$L:\cube^{k}\to\cube^{n}$ it is the case that $f(L(v_{1})),...,f(L(v_{k}))$ do
not all equal 1. We show that this property is testable if the underlying
matroid specified by $v_{1},...,v_{k}$ is a graphic matroid. This extends
Green's result to an infinite class of new properties.
  Our techniques extend those of Green and in particular we establish a link
between the notion of "1-complexity linear systems" of Green and Tao, and
graphic matroids, to derive the results.
