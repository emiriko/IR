We extend a simple model of a charge trap coupled to a single-electron box to
energy ranges and parameters such that it gives new insights and predictions
readily observable in many experimental systems. We show that a single
background charge is enough to give lines of differential conductance in the
stability diagram of the quantum dot, even within undistorted Coulomb diamonds.
It also suppresses the current near degeneracy of the impurity charge, and
yields negative differential lines far from this degeneracy. We compare this
picture to two other accepted explanations for lines in diamonds, based
respectively on the excitation spectrum of a quantum dot and on fluctuations of
the density-of-states in the contacts. In order to discriminate between these
models we emphasize the specific features related to environmental charge
traps. Finally we show that our model accounts very well for all the anomalous
features observed in silicon nanowire quantum dots.
