The experimental evidence of the breakpoint on the current-voltage
characteristics (IVCs) of the stacks of intrinsic Josephson junctions (IJJs) is
presented. The influence of the capacitive coupling on the IVCs of
Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_y$ IJJs has been investigated. At 4.2 K, clear
breakpoint region is observed on the branches in the IVCs. It is found that the
hysteresis observed on the IVC is suppressed due to the coupling compared with
that expected from the McCumber parameter. Measurements agree well with the
results obtained by the theoretical model.
