We derive monogamy relations (tradeoffs) between strengths of violations of
Bell's inequalities from the non-signaling condition. Our result applies to
general Bell inequalities with an arbitrary large number of partners, outcomes
and measurement settings. The method is simple, efficient and does not require
linear programming. The results are used to derive optimal fidelity for
asymmetric cloning in nonsignaling theories.
