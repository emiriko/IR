We briefly present the eXtremely Fast Tracker stereo track upgrade for the
CDF Level 2 trigger system. This upgrade enabled full 3D track reconstruction
at Level 2 of the 3-Level CDF online triggering system. Using information
provided by the stereo layers of the Central Outer Tracker, we can decrease the
trigger rate due to fake tracks by requiring the tracks to be consistent with a
single vertex in all three dimensions but also by using the track information
to "point" to the various detector components. We will also discuss the
effectiveness of the Level 2 stereo track algorithm at achieving reduced
trigger rates with high efficiencies during high luminosity running.
