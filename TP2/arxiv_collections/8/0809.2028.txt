A number of observed phenomena in high energy physics and cosmology lack
their resolution within the Standard Model of particle physics. These puzzles
include neutrino oscillations, baryon asymmetry of the universe and existence
of dark matter. We discuss the suggestion that all these problems can be solved
by new physics which exists only below the electroweak scale. The dedicated
experiments that can confirm or rule out this possibility are discussed.
