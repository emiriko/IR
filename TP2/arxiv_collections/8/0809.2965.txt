For every total recursive time bound $t$, a constant fraction of all
compressible (low Kolmogorov complexity) strings is $t$-bounded incompressible
(high time-bounded Kolmogorov complexity); there are uncountably many infinite
sequences of which every initial segment of length $n$ is compressible to $\log
n$ yet $t$-bounded incompressible below ${1/4}n - \log n$; and there are
countable infinitely many recursive infinite sequence of which every initial
segment is similarly $t$-bounded incompressible. These results are related to,
but different from, Barzdins's lemma.
