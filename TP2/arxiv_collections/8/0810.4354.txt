We study the hydrodynamic sound mode using gauge/gravity correspondence by
examining a generic black brane background's response to perturbations. We
assume that the background is generated by a single scalar field, and then
generalize to the case of multiple scalar fields. The relevant differential
equations obeyed by the gauge invariant variables are presented in both cases.
Finally, we present an analytical solution to these equations in a special
case; this solution allows us to determine the speed of sound and bulk
viscosity for certain special metrics. These results may be useful in
determining sound mode transport coefficients in phenomenologically motivated
holographic models of strongly coupled systems.
