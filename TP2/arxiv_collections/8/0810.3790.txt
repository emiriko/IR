We propose a new coarse-grained model for the description of liquid-vapor
phase separation of colloid-polymer mixtures. The hard-sphere repulsion between
colloids and between colloids and polymers, which is used in the well-known
Asakura-Oosawa (AO) model, is replaced by Weeks-Chandler-Anderson potentials.
Similarly, a soft potential of height comparable to thermal energy is used for
the polymer-polymer interaction, rather than treating polymers as ideal gas
particles. It is shown by grand-canonical Monte Carlo simulations that this
model leads to a coexistence curve that almost coincides with that of the AO
model and the Ising critical behavior of static quantities is reproduced. Then
the main advantage of the model is exploited - its suitability for Molecular
Dynamics simulations - to study the dynamics of mean square displacements of
the particles, transport coefficients such as the self-diffusion and
interdiffusion coefficients, and dynamic structure factors. While the
self-diffusion of polymers increases slightly when the critical point is
approached, the self-diffusion of colloids decreases and at criticality the
colloid self-diffusion coefficient is about a factor of 10 smaller than that of
the polymers. Critical slowing down of interdiffusion is observed, which is
qualitatively similar to symmetric binary Lennard-Jones mixtures, for which no
dynamic asymmetry of self-diffusion coefficients occurs.
