We investigate the 1/N expansion proposed recently as a strategy to include
quantum fluctuation effects in the nonrelativistic, attractive Fermi gas at and
near unitarity. We extend the previous results by calculating the
next-to-leading order corrections to the critical temperature along the whole
BCS-BEC crossover. We demonstrate explicitly that the extrapolation from the
mean-field approximation, based on the $1/N$ expansion, provides a useful
approximation scheme only on the BCS side of the crossover. We then apply the
technique to the study of strongly interacting relativistic many-fermion
systems. Having in mind the application to color superconductivity in cold
dense quark matter, we develop, within a simple model, a formalism suitable to
compare the effects of order parameter fluctuations in phases with different
pairing patterns. Our main conclusion is that the relative correction to the
critical temperature is to a good accuracy proportional to the mean-field ratio
of the critical temperature and the chemical potential. As a consequence, it is
significant even rather deep in the BCS regime, where phenomenologically
interesting values of the quark-quark coupling are expected. Possible impact on
the phase diagram of color-superconducting quark matter is discussed.
