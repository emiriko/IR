In this note we give arguments in favor of the statement that the
contribution of the box diagram calculated for electron muon elastic scattering
can be considered an upper limit to electron proton scattering. As an exact QED
calculation can be performed, this statement is useful for constraining model
calculations involving the proton structure.
