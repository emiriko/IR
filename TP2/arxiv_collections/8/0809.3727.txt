The study of percolation in so-called {\em nested subgraphs} implies a
generalization of the concept of percolation since the results are not linked
to specific graph process. Here the behavior of such graphs at criticallity is
studied for the case where the nesting operation is performed in an
uncorrelated way. Specifically, I provide an analyitic derivation for the
percolation inequality showing that the cluster size distribution under a
generalized process of uncorrelated nesting at criticality follows a power law
with universal exponent $\gamma=3/2$. The relevance of the result comes from
the wide variety of processes responsible for the emergence of the giant
component that fall within the category of nesting operations, whose outcome is
a family of nested subgraphs.
