It is a standard exercise in mechanical engineering to infer the external
forces and torques on a body from its static shape and known elastic
properties. Here we apply this kind of analysis to distorted double-helical DNA
in complexes with proteins. We extract the local mean forces and torques acting
on each base-pair of bound DNA from high-resolution complex structures. Our
method relies on known elastic potentials and a careful choice of coordinates
of the well-established rigid base-pair model of DNA. The results are robust
with respect to parameter and conformation uncertainty. They reveal the complex
nano-mechanical patterns of interaction between proteins and DNA. Being
non-trivially and non-locally related to observed DNA conformations, base-pair
forces and torques provide a new view on DNA-protein binding that complements
structural analysis.
