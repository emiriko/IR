We classify operator systems $S\subseteq \mathcal B(H)$ that act on finite
dimensional Hilbert spaces by making use of the noncommutative Choquet
boundary. S is said to be {\em reduced} when its boundary ideal is 0. In the
category of operator systems, that property functions as semisimplicity does in
the category of complex Banach algebras.
  We construct explicit examples of reduced operator systems using sequences of
"parameterizing maps" $\Gamma_k: \mathbb C^r\to \mathcal B(H_k)$, $k=1,..., N$.
We show that every reduced operator system is isomorphic to one of these, and
that two sequences give rise to isomorphic operator systems if and only if they
are "unitarily equivalent" parameterizing sequences.
  Finally, we construct nonreduced operator systems $S$ that have a given
boundary ideal $K$ and a given reduced image in $C^*(S)/K$, and show that these
constructed examples exhaust the possibilities.
