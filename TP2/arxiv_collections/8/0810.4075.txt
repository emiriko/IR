We consider the exclusive diffractive dissociation of a proton into three
jets with large transverse momenta in the double-logarithmic approximation of
perturbative QCD. This process is sensitive to the proton unintegrated gluon
distribution at small x and to the proton light-cone distribution amplitudes.
According to our estimates, an observation of such processes in the early runs
at LHC is feasible for jet transverse momenta of the order of 5 GeV.
