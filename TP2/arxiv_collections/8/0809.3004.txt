The connection between B_s mixing phase and lepton flavor violation is
studied in SU(5) GUT. The O(1) phase, preferring a non-vanishing squark mixing,
generically implies tau -> (e + mu) gamma and mu -> e gamma. In addition to the
facts already well-known, stresses are put on the role of gaugino to scalar
mass ratio at the GUT scale and the possible modifications due to
Planck-suppressed non-renormalizable operators.
