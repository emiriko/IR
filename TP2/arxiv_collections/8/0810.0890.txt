We present a Bayesian estimation analysis for a particular trace gas
detection technique with species separation provided by differential diffusion.
The proposed method collects a sample containing multiple gas species into a
common volume, and then allows it to diffuse across a linear array of optical
absorption detectors, using, for example, high-finesse Fabry-Perot cavities.
The estimation procedure assumes that all gas parameters (e.g. diffusion
constants, optical cross sections) are known except for the number population
of each species, which are determined from the time-of-flight absorption
profiles in each detector.
