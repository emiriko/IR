After overviewing the general features of semileptonic decays of the tau
lepton, I will recall the most widely used model for them, namely that of
Kuhn-Santamaria (KS), and I will explain the subsequent works that were done
along these lines and that are implemented in the TAUOLA library for analysing
tau decays. After that, I will move to the description of our project that aims
to achieve a theory as close as possible to QCD for the considered decays. I
conclude by emphasizing the importance of the implementation of our work in
TAUOLA.
