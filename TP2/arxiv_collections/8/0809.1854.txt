By simple elementary method,we obtain with ease,a highly simple expression
for the remainder term of the divisor problem and use it to obtain an
Euler-Maclaurin analogue of summation involving divisor function.We also obtain
a relation connecting the remainder term of the divisor problem and the
remainders of approximate functional equations for Riemann zeta function and
its square,for positive values of arguments.
