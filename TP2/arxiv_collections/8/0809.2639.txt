The standard approach to the design of individual space-time codes is based
on optimizing diversity and coding gains. This geometric approach leads to
remarkable examples, such as perfect space-time block codes, for which the
complexity of Maximum Likelihood (ML) decoding is considerable. Code diversity
is an alternative and complementary approach where a small number of feedback
bits are used to select from a family of space-time codes. Different codes lead
to different induced channels at the receiver, where Channel State Information
(CSI) is used to instruct the transmitter how to choose the code. This method
of feedback provides gains associated with beamforming while minimizing the
number of feedback bits. It complements the standard approach to code design by
taking advantage of different (possibly equivalent) realizations of a
particular code design. Feedback can be combined with sub-optimal low
complexity decoding of the component codes to match ML decoding performance of
any individual code in the family. It can also be combined with ML decoding of
the component codes to improve performance beyond ML decoding performance of
any individual code. One method of implementing code diversity is the use of
feedback to adapt the phase of a transmitted signal as shown for 4 by 4
Quasi-Orthogonal Space-Time Block Code (QOSTBC) and multi-user detection using
the Alamouti code. Code diversity implemented by selecting from equivalent
variants is used to improve ML decoding performance of the Golden code. This
paper introduces a family of full rate circulant codes which can be linearly
decoded by fourier decomposition of circulant matrices within the code
diversity framework. A 3 by 3 circulant code is shown to outperform the
Alamouti code at the same transmission rate.
