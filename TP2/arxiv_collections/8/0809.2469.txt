The scalar field can behave like a fluid with equation of state
$p_{\phi}=w\rho_{\phi}$, where $w \in [-1,1]$. In this Letter we derive a class
of the scalar field potentials for which $w=$ const. Scalar field with such a
potential can mimic ordinary matter, radiation, cosmic strings, etc. We perform
our calculations in the framework of the loop cosmology with holonomy
corrections. We solve the model analytically for the whole parameter space.
Subsequently, we perform similar consideration for the model with a phantom
field ($w<-1$). We show that scalar field is monotonic function in both cases.
This indicates that it can be treated as a well-defined internal time for these
models. Moreover we perform preliminary studies of the scalar field
perturbations with this potential. We indicate that non-Gaussian features are
present admitting for the possible observational constraints of the model.
