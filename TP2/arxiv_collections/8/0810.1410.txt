One-electron self-energy in the $t$-$J$ model was computed using a recently
developed large-$N$ method based on the path integral representation for
Hubbard operators. One of the main features of the self-energy is its strong
asymmetry with respect to the Fermi level, showing the spectra mostly
concentrated at high negative energy. This asymmetry is responsible for the
existence of incoherent structures at high negative energy in the spectral
functions. It is shown that dynamical non-double-occupancy excitations are
relevant for the behavior of the self-energy. It is difficult to understand the
asymmetry shown by the self-energy from weak coupling treatments. We compare
our results with others in recent literature. Finally, the possible relevance
of our results for the recent high energy features observed in photoemission
experiments is discussed.
