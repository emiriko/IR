The goal of this paper is first of all to propose a strategy to attack the
generalized Hodge conjecture for coniveau 2 complete intersections, and
secondly to state a conjecture concerning the cones of effective cycle classes
in intermediate dimensions. Our main results show that the generalized Hodge
conjecture for coniveau 2 complete intersections would follow from a particular
case of this effectiveness conjecture.
