With the commissioning of the LHC expected in 2009, and the LHC upgrades
expected in 2012, ATLAS and CMS are planning for detector upgrades for their
innermost layers requiring radiation hard technologies. Chemical Vapor
Deposition (CVD) diamond has been used extensively in beam conditions monitors
as the innermost detectors in the highest radiation areas of BaBar, Belle and
CDF and is now planned for all LHC experiments. This material is now being
considered as an alternate sensor for use very close to the interaction region
of the super LHC where the most extreme radiation conditions will exist.
Recently the RD42 collaboration constructed, irradiated and tested
polycrystalline and single-crystal chemical vapor deposition diamond sensors to
the highest fluences available. We present beam test results of chemical vapor
deposition diamond up to fluences of 1.8 x 10^16 protons/cm^2 showing that both
polycrystalline and single-crystal chemical vapor deposition diamonds follow a
single damage curve allowing one to extrapolate their performance as a function
of dose.
