Recently there are several evidences of the increase of the total cross
section sigma(tot) to be log2 s consistent with the Froissart unitarity bound,
and the COMPETE collaborations in the PDG have further assumed sigma(tot) = B
log2(s/s0) to extend its universal rise with a common value of B for all the
hadronic scatterings. However, there is no rigorous proof yet based only on
QCD. Therefore, it is worthwhile to prove this universal rise of sigma(tot)
even empirically. In this letter we attempt to obtain the value of B for pi p
scattering, B(pi p), with reasonable accuracy by taking into account the rich
pi p data in all the energy regions. We use the finite-energy sum rule(FESR)
expressed in terms of the pi p scattering data in the low and intermediate
energies as a constraint between high-energy parameters. We then have searched
for the simultaneous best fit to the sigma(tot) and rho ratios, the ratios of
the real to imaginary parts of the forward scattering amplitudes. The lower
energy data are included in the integral of FESR, the more precisely determined
is the non-leading term such as log s, and then helps to determine the leading
terms like log2 s. We have derived the value of B(pi p) as B(pi p)=0.311 +-
0.044mb. This value is to be compared with the value of B for pbarp,pp
scattering, B(pp), in our previous analysis[11], B(pp)=0.289 +- 0.023mb. Thus,
our result appears to support the universality hypothesis.
