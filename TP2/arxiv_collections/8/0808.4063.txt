The hyperfine interaction between the electron spin and the nuclear spins is
one of the main sources of decoherence for spin qubits when the nuclear spins
are disordered. An ordering of the latter largely suppresses this source of
decoherence. Here we show that such an ordering can occur through a
thermodynamic phase transition in two-dimensional (2D) Kondo-lattice type
systems. We specifically focus on nuclear spins embedded in a 2D electron gas.
The nuclear spins interact with each other through the RKKY interaction, which
is carried by the electron gas. We show that a nuclear magnetic order at finite
temperature relies on the anomalous behavior of the 2D static electron spin
susceptibility due to electron-electron interactions. This provides a
connection between low-dimensional magnetism and non-analyticities in
interacting 2D electron systems. We discuss the conditions for nuclear
magnetism, and show that the associated Curie temperature increases with the
electron-electron interactions and may reach up into the millikelvin regime.
The further reduction of dimensionality to one dimension is shortly discussed.
