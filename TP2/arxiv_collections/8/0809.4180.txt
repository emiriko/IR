We consider, within the algebraic formalism, the time dependence of fidelity
for qubits encoded into an open physical system. We relate the decay of
fidelity to the evolution of correlation functions and, in the particular case
of a Markovian dynamics, to the spectral gap of the generator of the semigroup.
The results are applicable to the analysis of models of quantum memories.
