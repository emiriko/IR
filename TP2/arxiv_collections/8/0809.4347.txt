A ray-rotation sheet consists of miniaturized optical components that
function - ray optically - as a homogeneous medium that rotates the local
direction of transmitted light rays around the sheet normal by an arbitrary
angle [A. C. Hamilton et al., arXiv:0809.2646 (2008)]. Here we show that two or
more parallel ray-rotation sheets perform imaging between two planes. The image
is unscaled and un-rotated. No other planes are imaged. When seen through
parallel ray-rotation sheets, planes that are not imaged appear rotated,
whereby the rotation angle changes with the ratio between the observer's and
the object plane's distance from the sheets.
