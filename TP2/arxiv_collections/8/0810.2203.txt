We give a classification theorem for certain four-dimensional families of
geometric $\lambda$-adic Galois representations attached to a pure motive. More
precisely, we consider families attached to the cohomology of a smooth
projective variety defined over $\Q$ with coefficients in a quadratic imaginary
field, non-selfdual and with four different Hodge-Tate weights. We prove that
the image is as large as possible for almost every $\lambda$ provided that the
family is irreducible and not induced from a family of smaller dimension. If we
restrict to semistable families an even simpler classification is given. A
version of the main result is given for the case where the family is attached
to an automorphic form.
