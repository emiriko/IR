A geometric interpretation for the A-fidelity between two states of a qubit
system is presented, which leads to an upper bound of the Bures fidelity. The
metrics defined based on the A-fidelity are studied by numerical method. An
alternative generalization of the A-fidelity, which has the same geometric
picture, to a $N$-state quantum system is also discussed.
