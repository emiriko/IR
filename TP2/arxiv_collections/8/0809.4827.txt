A new mechanism of nano-catalyst generation based on the spinodal
nano-decomposition in self-regenerating perovskite catalysts for
automotive-emissions control is proposed. To demonstrate existence of the
spinodal nano-decomposition in real perovskite catalysts, we performed
first-principles calculations to evaluate the free energy of
La(Fe$_{1-x}$Pd$_x$)O$_3$ and La(Fe$_{1-x}$Rh$_x$)O$_3$. The result indicates
appearance of a spinodal region in the phase diagram of each material.
Formation of nano-catalyst particles in the perovskite host matrix is crucial
for the self-regeneration of perovskite catalyst. Based on the spinodal
nano-decomposition model, possible materials are designed for new three-way
catalyst with no contents of precious metal.
