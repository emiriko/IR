The moment operators of a semispectral measure having the structure of the
convolution of a positive measure and a semispectral measure are studied, with
paying attention to the natural domains of these unbounded operators. The
results are then applied to conveniently determine the moment operators of the
Cartesian margins of the phase space observables.
