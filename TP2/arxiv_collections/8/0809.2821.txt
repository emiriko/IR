We show that general string-net condensed states have a natural
representation in terms of tensor product states (TPS) . These TPS's are built
from local tensors. They can describe both states with short-range entanglement
(such as the symmetry breaking states) and states with long-range entanglement
(such as string-net condensed states with topological/quantum order). The
tensor product representation provides a kind of 'mean-field' description for
topologically ordered states and could be a powerful way to study quantum phase
transitions between such states. As an attempt in this direction, we show that
the constructed TPS's are fixed-points under a certain wave-function
renormalization group transformation for quantum states.
