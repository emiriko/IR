In the first part of this text, we define motivic Artin L-fonctions via a
motivic Euler product, and show that they coincide with the analogous functions
introduced by Dhillon and Minac. In the second part, we define under some
assumptions a motivic Tamagawa number and show that it specializes to the
Tamagawa number introduced by Peyre in the context of Manin's conjectures about
rational points of bounded height on Fano varieties.
