We introduce a lattice symmetry relation for field theories with general
linear symmetries. For chiral symmetry the well-known Ginsparg-Wilson relation
is reproduced. The new relation encodes the remnant of the original symmetry on
the lattice and guides the construction of invariant lattice actions. We apply
this approach to lattice supersymmetry. There, an additional constraint has to
be satisfied which originates in the derivative operator in the symmetry
transformations. As a consequence the non-local SLAC derivative operator
appears in the lattice transformation. Despite this non-local form we show how
local solutions for quadratic actions can be found. For interacting theories
the relation in general leads to a non-polynomial action that can be reduced to
a finite polynomial order only under certain conditions.
