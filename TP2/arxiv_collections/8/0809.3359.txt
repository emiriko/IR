We present a novel quantum tomographic reconstruction method based on
Bayesian inference via the Kalman filter update equations. The method not only
yields the maximum likelihood/optimal Bayesian reconstruction, but also a
covariance matrix expressing the measurement uncertainties in a complete way.
  From this covariance matrix the error bars on any derived quantity can be
easily calculated. This is a first step towards the broader goal of devising an
omnibus reconstruction method that could be adapted to any tomographic setup
with little effort and that treats measurement uncertainties in a statistically
well-founded way.
  In this first part we restrict ourselves to the important subclass of
tomography based on measurements with discrete outcomes (as opposed to
continuous ones), and we also ignore any measurement imperfections (dark
counts, less than unit detector efficiency, etc.), which will be treated in a
follow-up paper. We illustrate our general theory on real tomography
experiments of quantum optical information processing elements.
