Bandstructure effects in PMOS transport of strongly quantized silicon
nanowire field-effect-transistors (FET) in various transport orientations are
examined. A 20-band sp3d5s* spin-orbit-coupled (SO) atomistic tight-binding
model coupled to a self consistent Poisson solver is used for the valence band
dispersion calculation. A ballistic FET model is used to evaluate the
capacitance and current-voltage characteristics. The dispersion shapes and
curvatures are strong functions of device size, lattice orientation, and bias,
and cannot be described within the effective mass approximation. The anisotropy
of the confinement mass in the different quantization directions can cause the
charge to preferably accumulate in the (110) and secondly on the (112) rather
than (100) surfaces, leading to significant charge distributions for different
wire orientations. The total gate capacitance of the nanowire FET devices is,
however, very similar for all wires in all the transport orientations
investigated ([100], [110], [111]), and is degraded from the oxide capacitance
by ~30%. The [111] and secondly the [110] oriented nanowires indicate highest
carrier velocities and better ON-current performance compared to [100] wires.
The dispersion features and quantization behavior, although a complicated
function of physical and electrostatic confinement, can be explained at first
order by looking at the anisotropic shape of the heavy-hole valence band.
