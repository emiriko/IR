We consider the possibility that the discrete long-range ordered states of
Er2Ti2O7 are selected energetically at the mean field level as an alternative
scenario that suggests selection via thermal fluctuations. We show that nearest
neighbour exchange interactions alone are not sufficient for this purpose, but
that anisotropies arising from excited single ion crystal field states in
Er2Ti2O7, together with appropriate anisotropic exchange interactions, can
produce the required long range order. However, the effect of the single ion
anisotropies is rather weak so we expect thermal or quantum fluctuations, in
some guise, to be ultimately important in this material. We reproduce recent
experimental results for the variation of magnetic Bragg peak intensities as a
function of magnetic field.
