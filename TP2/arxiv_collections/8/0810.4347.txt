We analytically identify sufficient conditions for manifesting thermal
rectification in two-terminal hybrid structures within the quantum master
equation formalism. We recognize two classes of rectifiers. In type A
rectifiers the contacts are dissimilar. In type B rectifiers the contacts are
equivalent, but the system and baths have different particle statistics, and
the system is (parametrically) asymmetrically coupled to the baths. Our study
applies to various hybrid junctions including metals, dielectrics, and spins.
