We develop a means of simulating the evolution and measurement of a
multipartite quantum state under discrete or continuous evolution using another
quantum system with states and operators lying in a real Hilbert space. This
extends previous results which were unable to simulate local evolution and
measurements with local operators and was limited to discrete evolution. We
also detail applications to Bell inequalities and self-testing of quantum
apparatus.
