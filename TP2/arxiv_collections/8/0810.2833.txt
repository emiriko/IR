The background field method has been used successfully to determine hadron
electromagnetic polarizabilities. Recently questions have been raised regarding
the proper way to deal with the electric field on the lattice. In this paper,
we show how the presence of a background electric field affects the quark
hopping matrix. We use this formulation to carry out simulations on quenched
configurations, and we present the results for neutron electric polarizability
for pion masses as low as $500\MeV$. We find that the polarizability is roughly
constant for the quark masses considered, $\alpha\sim 1.5 \times 10^{-4}
\fm^3$. While the polarizability is positive, it is significantly smaller than
the experimental value due to the fact that the quark masses used are too
large.
