Models of Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) physics, like the Minimal
Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM), often involve an extended Higgs sector,
giving rise to extra neutral or charged Higgs bosons. The discovery reach
expected from simulation studies for such additional Higgs particles is
presented for the ATLAS, CMS and FP420 detectors at the LHC. Emphasis is put on
production and decay modes involving heavy flavour b and tau particles, which
are enhanced in large regions of BSM parameter space. The LHC experiments are
indeed particularly well equipped to tackle final states containing heavy
flavour.
