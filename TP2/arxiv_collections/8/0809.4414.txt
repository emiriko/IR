We use the example of the cuboctahedron, a highly frustrated molecule with 12
sites, to study the approach to the classical limit. We compute magnetic
susceptibility, specific heat, and magnetic cooling rate at high magnetic
fields and low temperatures for different spin quantum numbers s. Remarkably
big deviations of these quantities from their classical counterparts are
observed even for values of s which are usually considered to be almost
classical.
