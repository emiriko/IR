We list the subgroups of the basis set of Cl_{3,0} and classify them
according to three criteria for construction of universal Clifford algebras:
(1) each generator squares to +1 or -1, (2) the generators within the group
anticommute, and (3) the order of the resulting group is 2^{n+1}, where n is
the number of nontrivial generators. Obedient groups we call choirs;
disobedient groups, bands. We classify choirs by modes and bands by rhythms,
based on canonical equality. Each band generator has a transposition (number of
other generators it commutes with). The band's transposition signature is the
band's chord. The sum of transpositions divided by twice the number of
generator pair combinations is the band's beat. The band's order deviation is
the band's disorder. For n less than or equal 3, we show that the Cl_{3,0}
basis set has 21 non-isomorphic subgroups consisting of 9 choirs and 12 bands.
