We develop the foundations of the deformation theory of compact complete
affine space forms and affine crystallographic groups. Using methods from the
theory of linear algebraic groups we show that these deformation spaces inherit
an algebraic structure from the space of crystallographic homomorphisms. We
also study the properties of the action of the homotopy mapping class groups on
deformation spaces. In our context these groups are arithmetic groups, and we
construct examples of flat affine manifolds where every finite group of mapping
classes admits a fixed point on the deformation space. We also show that the
existence of fixed points on the deformation space is equivalent to the
realisation of finite groups of homotopy equivalences by finite groups of
affine diffeomorphisms. Extending ideas of Auslander we relate the deformation
spaces of affine space forms with solvable fundamental group to deformation
spaces of manifolds with nilpotent fundamental group. We give applications
concerning the classification problem for affine space forms.
