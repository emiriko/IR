We present a method of control of chaos in area-preserving maps. This method
gives an explicit expression of a control term which is added to a given
area-preserving map. The resulting controlled map which is a small and suitable
modification of the original map, is again area-preserving and has an invariant
curve whose equation is explicitly known.
