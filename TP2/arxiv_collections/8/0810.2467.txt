We consider the random walk on supercritical percolation clusters in the
d-dimensional Euclidean lattice. Previous papers have obtained Gaussian heat
kernel bounds, and a.s. invariance principles for this process. We show how
this information leads to a parabolic Harnack inequality, a local limit theorem
and estimates on the Green's function.
