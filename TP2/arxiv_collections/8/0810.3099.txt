Elastic and inelastic cross section of proton-proton and electron-proton
scattering are discussed. Special attention is given to elastic scattering and
to the striking difference between the data of these two kinds of experiments.
It is shown that the regular charge-monopole theory explains the main features
of the data. Predictions of results of CERN's Large Hadron Collider are pointed
out.
