In a numerical experiment based on Gross-Pitaevskii formalism, we demonstrate
unique topological quantum coherence in optically trapped Bose-Einstein
condensates (BECs). Exploring the fact that vortices in rotating BEC can be
pinned by a geometric arrangement of laser beams, we show the parameter range
in which vortex-antivortex molecules or multiquantum vortices are formed as a
consequence of the optically imposed symmetry. Being low-energy states, we
discuss the conditions for spontaneous nucleation of these unique molecules and
their direct experimental observation, and provoke the potential use of the
phase print of an antivortex or a multiquantum vortex when realized in
unconventional circumstances.
