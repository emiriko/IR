We demonstrate the equilibration of isolated macroscopic quantum systems,
prepared in non-equilibrium mixed states with significant population of many
energy levels, and observed by instruments with a reasonably bound working
range compared to the resolution limit. Both properties are fulfilled under
many, if not all, experimentally realistic conditions. At equilibrium, the
predictions and limitations of Statistical Mechanics are recovered.
