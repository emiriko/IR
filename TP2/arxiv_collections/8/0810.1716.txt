The in-plane magnetic penetration depth \lambda_{ab} of the iron selenide
superconductor with the nominal composition FeSe_0.85 was studied by means of
muon-spin rotation. The measurements of \lambda_{ab}^{-2}(T) are inconsistent
with the presence of nodes in the gap as well as with a simple isotropic s-wave
type of the order parameter, but can be equally well described within a two-gap
(s+s) and an anisotropic s-wave gap picture. This implies that the
superconducting energy gap in FeSe_0.85 contains no nodes.
