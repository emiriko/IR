We provide evidence for the influence of thermal fluctuations of Goldstone
modes on the chiral condensate at finite temperature. We show that at fixed
temperature, T<Tc, in the vicinity of the chiral transition temperature this
leads to a characteristic dependence of the chiral condensate on the square
root of the light quark mass (m_l), which is expected for 3-dimensional models
with broken O(N) symmetry. As a consequence the chiral susceptibility shows a
strong quark mass dependence for all temperatures below Tc and diverges like
1/sqrt(m_l) in the chiral limit.
