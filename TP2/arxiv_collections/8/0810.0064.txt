The goal of this paper is to employ a "preclusion principle" originally
suggested by Rafael Sorkin in order to come up with a relativistically
covariant model of quantum mechanics and gravity. Space-time is viewed as
geometry as opposed to dynamics, and "unwanted" histories in that geometry are
precluded.
