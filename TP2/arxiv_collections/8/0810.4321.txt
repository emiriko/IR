We report on recent Z (+jets) measurements from the Fermilab Tevatron proton
anti-proton collider. A new D0 measurement of the transverse momentum of Z
bosons yields the best measurement to date of the non-perturbative form factor,
g2. The production of Z+jets is an major background to many rare signals, and
is a vital testing ground for theoretical predictions. Measurements from CDF
and D0 of differential cross sections in Z+jet production test NLO pQCD, and in
the case of D0, the latest tree-level matrix element with matched parton shower
calculations. Improving modelling of this signal will impact results from the
Fermilab Tevatron and CERN LHC.
