We present a fluid dynamics video showing the results of a 9-billion atom
molecular dynamics simulation of complex fluid flow in molten copper and
aluminum. Starting with an atomically flat interface, a shear is imposed along
the copper-aluminum interface and random atomic fluctuations seed the formation
of vortices. These vortices grow due to the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. The
resulting vortical structures are beautifully intricate, decorated with
secondary instabilities and complex mixing phenomena. This work performed under
the auspices of the U.S. Department of Energy by Lawrence Livermore National
Laboratory under Contract DE-AC52-07NA27344.
