Energetics of the fcc ($\gamma$) - bcc ($\alpha$) lattice transformation by
the Bain tetragonal deformation is calculated for both magnetically ordered and
paramagnetic (disordered local moment) states of iron. The first-principle
computational results manifest a relevance of the magnetic order in a scenario
of the $\gamma$ - $\alpha$ transition and reveal a special role of the Curie
temperature of $\alpha$-Fe, $T_C$, where a character of the transformation is
changed. At a cooling down to the temperatures $T < T_C$ one can expect that
the transformation is developed as a lattice instability whereas for $T > T_C$
it follows a standard mechanism of creation and growth of an embryo of the new
phase. It explains a closeness of $T_C$ to the temperature of start of the
martensitic transformation, $M_s$.
