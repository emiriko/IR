We present a scheme for multipartite entanglement purification of quantum
systems in a Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state with quantum nondemolition
detectors (QNDs). This scheme does not require the controlled-not gates which
cannot be implemented perfectly with linear optical elements at present, but
QNDs based on cross-Kerr nonlinearities. It works with two steps, i.e., the
bit-flipping error correction and the phase-flipping error correction. These
two steps can be iterated perfectly with parity checks and simple single-photon
measurements. This scheme does not require the parties to possess sophisticated
single photon detectors. These features maybe make this scheme more efficient
and feasible than others in practical applications.
