Maximal orders of rank 4 on the projective plane, ramified on a smooth plane
quartic are examples of exotic del Pezzo orders. We compute the possible Chern
classes for line bundles on such orders and show the moduli space of line
bundles with minimal second Chern class is either a point or a smooth genus two
curve.
