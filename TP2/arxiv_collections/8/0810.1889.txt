Superlattice of spin vortices has been proposed in an earlier article as an
alternative to the stripe interpretation of spin modulations in 1/8-doped
lanthanum cuprates. The present article addresses several additional
characteristics of the spin vortex lattice, namely: (i) the nature of extended
charge states; (ii) the position of neutron spin peaks as a function of doping;
and (iii) the absence of higher order spin harmonics. All these characteristics
afford straightforward connection to the experimental results produced by
angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, resistivity measurements, and
neutron scattering.
