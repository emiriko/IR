Using the algebraic structure of the Stone-Cech compactification of the
integers, Furstenberg and Glasner proved that for arbitrary k, every piecewise
syndetic set contains a piecewise syndetic set of k-term arithmetic
progressions.
  We present a purely combinatorial argument which allows to derive this result
directly from van der Waerden's Theorem.
