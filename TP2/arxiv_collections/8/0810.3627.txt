The MINOS experiment observes the NuMI beam produced by the Main Injector
accelerator at two detector stations, one 1 km and the other 735 km from the
neutrino production target. From the disappearance of neutrinos in flight
between the two detectors, we measure the neutrino oscillation parameters
$\Delta m_{23}^2$ and $\sin^2(2\theta_{23})$ and update our previously
published result. Additionally, we have searched for evidence of additional
light neutrino families which do not couple to the weak interaction. Finally,
we discuss the status of our search for the appearance of $\nu_{e}$, an effect
expected if the mixing angle $\theta_{13}$ is non-zero and required if the goal
of CP violation in the neutrino sector is to be observed.
