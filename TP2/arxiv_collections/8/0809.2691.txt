With the rise of XML as a standard for representing business data, XML data
warehouses appear as suitable solutions for Web-based decision-support
applications. In this context, it is necessary to allow OLAP analyses over XML
data cubes (XOLAP). Thus, XQuery extensions are needed. To help define a formal
framework and allow much-needed performance optimizations on analytical queries
expressed in XQuery, having an algebra at one's disposal is desirable. However,
XOLAP approaches and algebras from the literature still largely rely on the
relational model and/or only feature a small number of OLAP operators. In
opposition, we propose in this paper to express a broad set of OLAP operators
with the TAX XML algebra.
