Results on the search for particles decaying into Zgamma to llgamma are
presented. Using roughly 1 fb-1 of data, dilepton-plus-photon invariant mass
distributions have been examined for an excess over the theoretical
predictions. Having observed a good agreement between data and the standard
model prediction we set 95% C.L. upper limits on the cross section times
branching fraction (sigma x B) of the resonance Zgamma production.
