The eikonal description of breakup reactions diverges because of the Coulomb
interaction between the projectile and the target. This divergence is due to
the adiabatic, or sudden, approximation usually made, which is incompatible
with the infinite range of the Coulomb interaction. A correction for this
divergence is analysed by comparison with the Dynamical Eikonal Approximation,
which is derived without the adiabatic approximation. The correction consists
in replacing the first-order term of the eikonal Coulomb phase by the
first-order of the perturbation theory. This allows taking into account both
nuclear and Coulomb interactions on the same footing within the computationally
efficient eikonal model. Excellent results are found for the dissociation of
11Be on lead at 69 MeV/nucleon. This Coulomb Corrected Eikonal approximation
provides a competitive alternative to more elaborate reaction models for
investigating breakup of three-body projectiles at intermediate and high
energies.
