In an earlier paper we developed a Parton Bubble Model (PBM) for RHIC/LHC,
based on a substructure of a ring of localized bubbles which initially contain
3-4 partons of almost entirely gluons. A Glasma Flux Tube Model (GFTM) which
formed longitudinal flux tubes in the transverse plane of two colliding sheets
of Color Glass Condensate (CGC) which pass through one another had been
developed. These sheets create boost invariant flux tubes of longitudinal color
electric and magnetic fields. A blast wave gives the tubes near the surface
transverse flow in the same way it gave flow to the bubbles in the PBM. In this
paper we connect the equivalent characteristics of the PBM to the GFTM and show
that the intermediate transverse momentum charged-two-particle angular
correlations of the most central and highest energy RHIC Au + Au collisions are
explained. When one considers a 3-4 GeV/c transverse momentum tagged charged
trigger particle in combination with other intermediate transverse momentum
charged particles, the ridge correlation is generated and explained. The
longitudinal color electric and magnetic fields of GFTM have a non-zero
topological charge density $F \widetilde $F. These fields cause a local strong
CP violation which effects charged particle production coming from quarks and
anti-quarks created in the tube or bubble. We developed four-charged-particle
correlations which show this CP effect and accumulate from bubble to bubble
independent of whether particles are pushed or pulled and rotated in a right or
left handed direction, We demonstrate strong evidence for the predicted color
electric field using previously published experimental data. We developed 4
particle correlations for obtaining evidence for the predicted color magnetic
field.
