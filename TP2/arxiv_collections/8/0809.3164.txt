We study the absorption probability and Hawking radiation spectra of a
phantom scalar field in the Kerr black hole spacetime. We find that the
presence of the negative kinetic energy terms modifies the standard results in
the greybody factor, super-radiance and Hawking radiation. Comparing with the
usual scalar particle, the phantom scalar emission is enhanced in the black
hole spacetime.
