We derive relations between standard order parameter correlations and the
noise correlations in time of flight images, which are valid for systems with
long range order as well as low dimensional systems with algebraic decay of
correlations. Both Bosonic and Fermionic systems are considered. For one
dimensional Fermi systems we show that the noise correlations are equally
sensitive to spin, charge and pairing correlations and may be used to
distinguish between fluctuations in the different channels. This is in contrast
to linear response experiments, such as Bragg spectroscopy, which are only
sensitive to fluctuations in the particle-hole channel (spin or charge). For
Bosonic systems we find a sharp peak in the noise correlation at opposite
momenta that signals pairing correlations in the depletion cloud. In a
condensate with true long range order, this peak is a delta function and we can
use Bogoliubov theory to study its temperature dependence. Interestingly we
find that it is enhanced with temperature in the low temperature limit. In one
dimensional condensates with only quasi-long range (i.e. power-law) order the
peak in the noise correlations also broadens to a power-law singularity.
