The CALICE Collaboration is carrying out research and development into
calorimetry for a detector at the International Linear Collider (ILC). CALICE
is investigating a range of technologies for both electromagnetic and hadronic
calorimetry. An overview of the prototypes and selected test-beam results are
presented.
