We give a short and unified proof of Hardy-Lieb-Thirring inequalities for
moments of eigenvalues of fractional Schroedinger operators. The proof covers
the optimal parameter range. It is based on a recent inequality by Solovej,
Soerensen, and Spitzer. Moreover, we prove that any non-magnetic Lieb-Thirring
inequality implies a magnetic Lieb-Thirring inequality (with possibly a larger
constant).
