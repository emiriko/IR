We report $^{75}$As nuclear quadrupole resonance (NQR) studies on
superconducting oxypnictide LaFeAsO$_{0.92}$F$_{0.08}$ ($T_{\rm c}$ = 23 K).
The temperature dependence of the spin lattice relaxation rate (1/$T_1$)
decreases below $T_{\rm c}$ without a coherence (Hebel-Slichter) peak and shows
a temperature dependence that is not simple power-law nor exponential. We show
that the result can be understood in terms of two superconducting gaps of
either $d$- or ${\pm}s$-wave symmetry, with the larger gap $\Delta_1\sim 4
k_{\rm B}T_{\rm c}$ and the smaller one $\Delta_2 \sim 1.5 k_{\rm B}T_{\rm c}$.
Our result suggests that the multiple-gaps feature is universal in the
oxypnictides superconductors, which is probably associated with the multiple
electronic bands structure in this new class of materials. We also find that
1/$T_1T$ above $T_{\rm c}$ increases with decreasing temperature, which
suggests weak magnetic fluctuations in the normal state.
