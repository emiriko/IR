We present a search for large extra dimensions in the single photon plus
missing transverse energy channel (Kaluza-Klein graviton production) performed
using 2.7 fb-1 of data collected by the D0 experiment at the Fermilab Tevatron
collider. At 95% C.L., we set limits on the fundamental Planck scale M_{D} from
970 GeV to 816 GeV for two to eight extra dimensions.
