This resonance is similar in character to other resonances in atomic physics.
It is parameterized by its energy and its lifetime. A numerical discretization
technique, the mapped Fourier grid method (MFG) is extended to the Dirac
equation and is used to solve for the resonance parameters of a quasimolecular
supercritical 1S$\sigma$ state which arises, e.g., in a uranium-uranium
collision. Direct methods using only the MFG method are shown to give
reasonable estimates for the resonance parameters. Analytic continuation
methods such as complex scaling (CS) of the coordinate or adding a complex
absorbing potential (CAP) are then applied. They allow for more accurate
determinations of the supercritical resonance parameters. The (extrapolated)
augmented analytic continuation methods are used to investigate the effects of
higher-order couplings, beyond the monopole approximation. For the nearly
charge symmetric system of U$^{92+}$-Cf$^{98+}$, it is shown that the S-D
quadrupole coupling is the next dominant interaction after the monopole
interaction. Collisions near the Coulomb barrier, in which supercritical
resonance states occur, are also calculated using the MFG. Results are
presented for the collision of U$^{92+}$-U$^{92+}$ for a zero-impact-parameter
Coulomb trajectory at a center-of-mass energy of 740MeV. The enhancement
effects to the positron spectrum due to nuclear sticking at closest approach is
examined. Results are given for sticking times of 2,5,10$\times10^{-21}$s.
Nuclear sticking is shown to offer the possibility of demonstrating
experimentally the existence of supercritical resonance states.
