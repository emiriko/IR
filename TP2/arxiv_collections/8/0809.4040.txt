This article is a sequel to the book `Ricci Flow and the Poincare Conjecture'
by the same authors. Using the main results of that book we establish the
Geometrization Conjecture for all compact, orientable three-manifolds following
the approach indicated by Perelman in his preprints on the subject. This
approach is to study the collapsed part of the manifold as time goes to
infinity in a Ricci flow with surgery. The main technique for this study is the
theory of Alexandrov spaces. This theory gives local models for the collapsed
part of the manifold. These local models can be glued together to prove that
the collapsed part of the manifold is a graph manifold with incompressible
boundary. From this and previous results, geometrization follows easily.
