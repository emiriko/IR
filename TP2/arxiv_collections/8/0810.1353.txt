We classify exactly when the toric algebras $\C[S_{\tree}(\br)]$ are
Gorenstein. These algebras arise as toric deformations of algebras of
invariants of the Cox-Nagata ring of the blow-up of $n-1$ points on
$\mathbb{P}^{n-3}$, or equivalently algebras of the ring of global sections for
the Pl\"ucker embedding of weight varieties of the Grassmanian $Gr_2(\C^n)$,
and algebras of global sections for embeddings of moduli of weighted points on
$\mathbb{P}^1$. As a corollary, we find exactly when these families of rings
are Gorenstein as well.
