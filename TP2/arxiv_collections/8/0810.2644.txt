We describe OpenFCI, an open source implementation of the full
configuration-interaction method (FCI) for two-dimensional quantum dots with
optional use of effective renormalized interactions. The code is written in C++
and is available under the Gnu General Public License. The code and core
libraries are well documented and structured in a way such that customizations
and generalizations to other systems and numerical methods are easy tasks. As
examples we provide a matrix element tabulation program and an implementation
of a simple model from nuclear physics, in addition to the quantum dot
application itself.
