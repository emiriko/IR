We calculate the cohomology rings of a collection of seven dimensional
manifolds supporting an S^3 x S^3-action with one dimensional orbit space.
These manifolds are of interest to differential geometers studying non-negative
and positive sectional curvature. From this collection, we identify several
families of manifolds for which there exist well-known topological invariants
distinguishing homeomorphism and diffeomorphism types.
