Franson's Bell experiment with energy-time entanglement [Phys. Rev. Lett. 62,
2205 (1989)] does not rule out all local hidden variable models. This defect
can be exploited to compromise the security of Bell inequality-based quantum
cryptography. We introduce a novel Bell experiment using genuine energy-time
entanglement, based on a novel interferometer, which rules out all local hidden
variable models. The scheme is feasible with actual technology.
