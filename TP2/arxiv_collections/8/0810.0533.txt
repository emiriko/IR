The NEMO experiment is investigating the neutrinoless double beta decay. The
NEMO-3 detector is taking data in the Frejus Underground Laboratory. The goal
of the SuperNEMO detector is to reach a sensitivity on the order of 10^26 year
on the half-life of the bb0nu process. The chosen isotopes for the future
detector are 82Se and 150Nd, because of the reduced background. The
collaboration has started a 3-year R&D development on all components : tracking
detector, calorimeter, source enrichment and purification, radiopurity
measurements.
