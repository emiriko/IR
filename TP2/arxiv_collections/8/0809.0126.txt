The quaternion spaces can be used to describe the property of electromagnetic
field and gravitational field. In the quaternion space, some coordinate
transformations can be deduced from the feature of quaternions, including
Lorentz transformation and Galilean transformation etc., when the coordinate
system is transformed into others. And some coordinate transformations with
variable speed of light can be obtained in the electromagnetic field and
gravitational field.
