Based upon flavor SU(3) symmetry, we perform global fits to charmless
  B decays into one pseudoscalar meson and one vector meson in the final
states. We consider different symmetry breaking schemes and find that the one
implied by na{\"i}ve factorization is slightly favored over the exact symmetry
case. The $(\bar\rho,\bar\eta)$ vertex of the unitarity triangle (UT)
constrained by our fits is consistent with other methods within errors. We have
found large color-suppressed, electroweak penguin and singlet penguin
amplitudes when the spectator quark ends up in the final-state vector meson.
Nontrivial relative strong phases are also required to explain the data. The
best-fit parameters are used to compute branching ratio and CP asymmetry
observables in all of the decay modes, particularly those in the $B_s$ decays
to be measured at the Tevatron and LHC experiments.
