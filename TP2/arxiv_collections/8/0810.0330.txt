We consider symmetric positive definite systems of linear equations with
multiple right-hand sides. The seed conjugate gradient method solves one
right-hand side with the conjugate gradient method and simultaneously projects
over the Krylov subspace thus developed for the other right-hand sides. Then
the next system is solved and used to seed the remaining ones. Rounding error
in the conjugate gradient method limits how much the seeding can improve
convergence. We propose three changes to the seed conjugate gradient method:
only the first right-hand side is used for seeding, this system is solved past
convergence, and the roundoff error is controlled with some
reorthogonalization. We will show that results are actually better with only
one seeding, even in the case of related right-hand sides. Controlling rounding
error gives the potential for rapid convergence for the second and subsequent
right-hand sides.
