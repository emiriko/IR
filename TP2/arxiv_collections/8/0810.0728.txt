Seshadri constants express the so called local positivity of a line bundle on
a projective variety. They were introduced by Demailly. The original idea of
using them towards a proof of the Fujita conjecture failed but they quickly
became a subject of intensive study quite in their own right. Lazarsfeld's book
"Positivity in Algebraic Geometry" contains a whole chapter devoted to local
positivity and serves as a very enjoyable introduction to Seshadri constants.
Since this book has appeared, the subject witnessed quite a bit of development.
It is the aim of these notes to give an account of recent progress as well as
to discuss many open questions and provide some examples.
