We present a self--consistent $E_6$ inspired supersymmetric model with an
extra $U(1)_{N}$ gauge symmetry under which right-handed neutrinos have zero
charge. We explore the particle spectrum within the constrained version of this
exceptional supersymmetric standard model (E$_6$SSM) and discuss its possible
collider signatures.
