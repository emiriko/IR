We calculate the pion vector and scalar form factors in two-flavor QCD. Gauge
configurations are generated with dynamical overlap quarks on a 16^3 x 32
lattice at a lattice spacing of 0.12 fm with sea quark masses down to a sixth
of the physical strange quark mass. Contributions of disconnected diagrams to
the scalar form factor is calculated employing the all-to-all quark
propagators. We present a detailed comparison of the vector and scalar radii
with chiral perturbation theory to two loops.
