We propose that a necessary condition of decrease of entropy in isolated
system is existence of internal interactions. Then a theoretical development
and some possible examples on decrease of entropy are researched. In quantum
region, in particular for some Bose systems, decrease of entropy is more
possible. The base of violation of Pauli exclusion principle is unified quantum
statistics and attractive interactions, which corresponds also to decrease of
entropy with internal interactions. Perhaps, some basis principles have
essential relations.
