Copper oxides become superconductors rapidly upon doping with electron holes,
suggesting a fundamental pairing instability. The Cooper mechanism explains
normal superconductivity as an instability of a fermi-liquid state, but
high-temperature superconductors derive from a Mott-insulator normal state, not
a fermi liquid. We show that precocity to pair condensation with doping is a
natural property of competing antiferromagnetism and d-wave superconductivity
on a singly-occupied lattice, thus generalizing the Cooper instability to doped
Mott insulators, with significant implications for the high-temperature
superconducting mechanism.
