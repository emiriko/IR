Very successful hadronization model for the production of mesons in the jets
of initial quarks was proposed thirty years ago by Field and Feynman. The model
is used so far in the design of experiments and for comparison with the
experimental data. In this work it is shown that correlation function in that
model, as a function of the energies of two final hadrons has interesting
properties (energies are taken in fractions of initial quark energy, and equal
$z_{1}$ and $z_{2}$, respectively). In particular, for some pairs of mesons
there are kinematic regions over variable $z_{2}$ (at fixed values of $z_{1}$),
where it is positive and unexpectedly large. The experimental investigation of
the correlation functions in these kinematic regions has twofold interest, from
one side it can help to investigate some delicate properties of quark jets and
from the other side can help to verify the physical suppositions of model, and
to obtain more precise values of parameters.
