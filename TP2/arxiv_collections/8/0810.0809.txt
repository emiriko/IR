Studies on electron antineutrino-electron elastic scattering were performed
using a 200-kg CsI(Tl) scintillating crystal detector array at the Kuo-Sheng
Nuclear Power Plant in Taiwan. The measured cross section of R(exp) = [1.00 +-
0.32(stat)]xR(SM) is consistent with the Standard Model expectation and the
corresponding weak mixing angle derived is sin2T = 0.24 +- 0.05 (stat). The
results are consistent with a destructive interference effect between neutral
and charged-currents in this process. Limits on neutrino magnetic moment of
mu(nu_(e)) < 2.0 x 10^(-10) mu_(B) at 90% confidence level and on electron
antineutrino charge radius of r^(2) < (0.12 +- 2.07)x10^(-32) cm^2 were also
derived.
