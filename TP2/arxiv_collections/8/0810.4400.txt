Phase transitions of the mixed spin-1/2 and spin-S (S >= 1/2) Ising model on
a three-dimensional (3D) decorated lattice with a layered magnetic structure
are investigated within the framework of a precise mapping relationship to the
simple spin-1/2 Ising model on the tetragonal lattice. This mapping
correspondence yields for the layered Ising model of mixed spins plausible
results either by adopting the conjectured solution for the spin-1/2 Ising
model on the orthorhombic lattice [Z.-D. Zhang, Philos. Mag. 87 (2007)
5309-5419] or by performing extensive Monte Carlo simulations for the
corresponding spin-1/2 Ising model on the tetragonal lattice. It is shown that
the critical behaviour markedly depends on a relative strength of axial
zero-field splitting parameter, inter- and intra-layer interactions. The
striking spontaneous order captured to the 'quasi-1D' spin system is found in a
restricted region of interaction parameters, where the zero-field splitting
parameter forces all integer-valued decorating spins towards their
'non-magnetic' spin state.
