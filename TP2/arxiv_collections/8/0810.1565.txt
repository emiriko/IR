It is shown that particles undergoing discrete-time jumps in 3D, starting at
a distance r0 from the center of an adsorbing sphere of radius R, are captured
with probability (R - c sigma)/r0 for r0 much greater than R, where c is
related to the Fourier transform of the scaled jump distribution and sigma is
the distribution's root-mean square jump length. For particles starting on the
surface of the sphere, the asymptotic survival probability is non-zero (in
contrast to the case of Brownian diffusion) and has a universal behavior
sigma/(R sqrt(6)) depending only upon sigma/R. These results have applications
to computer simulations of reaction and aggregation.
