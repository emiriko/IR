Using time-resolved Faraday rotation, the drift-induced spin-orbit Field of a
two-dimensional electron gas in an InGaAs quantum well is measured. Including
measurements of the electron mobility, the Dresselhaus and Rashba coefficients
are determined as a function of temperature between 10 and 80 K. By comparing
the relative size of these terms with a measured in-plane anisotropy of the
spin dephasing rate, the D'yakonv-Perel' contribution to spin dephasing is
estimated. The measured dephasing rate is significantly larger than this, which
can only partially be explained by an inhomogeneous g-factor.
