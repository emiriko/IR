A single Co atom adsorbed on Cu(111) or on ferromagnetic Co islands is
contacted with non-magnetic W or ferromagnetic Ni tips in a scanning tunneling
microscope. When the Co atom bridges two non-magnetic electrodes conductances
of 2e^2/h are found. With two ferromagnetic electrodes a conductance of e^2/h
is observed which may indicate fully spin-polarized transport.
