The new COMPASS Delta G/G result obtained from high transverse momentum
hadron pairs in the Q^2>1 GeV^2 region is presented. Comparing to the previous
analysis in this region the statistical error of Delta G/G is reduced by a
factor 3 to 0.10. A weighted method of the Delta G/G measurement based on
neural network approach is used. In addition, the formula for the Delta G/G
extraction used in the analysis has been updated. The contributions coming from
the leading order and QCD Compton processes are no longer neglected.
