With the help of a two-dimensional model we study rolling lubrication by
circular (2D fullerenes) molecules for a wide range of parameters. The
conditions under which microscopic rolling friction may be effective are
identified and related to the relative ingraining between substrate and
molecule, the latter behaving as a nanosized cogwheel.
