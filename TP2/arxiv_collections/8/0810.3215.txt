Spin-dependent short range interactions of free neutrons with matter may be
searched for in various ways. This short note discusses pseudomagnetic
precession of trapped ultracold neutrons in vicinity to bulk matter, which
should be several orders of magnitude more sensitive than any other method
proposed so far.
