A circuit capable of measuring nanoampere currents while floating at voltages
up to at least 25kV is described. The circuit relays its output to ground
potential via an optical fiber. We particularly emphasize the design and
construction techniques which allow robust operation in the presence of high
voltage spikes and discharges.
