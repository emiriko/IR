This paper is concerned with the linear ODE in the form
$y'(t)=\lambda\rho(t)y(t)+b(t)$, $\lambda <0$ which represents a simplified
storage model of the carbon in the soil. In the first part, we show that, for a
periodic function $\rho(t)$, a linear drift in the coefficient $b(t)$ involves
a linear drift for the solution of this ODE. In the second part, we extend the
previous results to a classical heat non-homogeneous equation. The connection
with an analytic semi-group associated to the ODE equation is considered in the
third part. Numerical examples are given.
