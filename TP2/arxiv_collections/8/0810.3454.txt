Final-state interaction effects in charmless B_{u,d,s} to PP decays are
studied. We investigate the B(bar)^0 to pi^+ pi^-, pi^0 pi^0 rates and the K pi
direct CP violations, which lead to the so-called K pi puzzle in CP violation
(Delta A). We found that sizable and complex color-suppressed tree amplitudes,
which are crucial for the large pi^0 pi^0 rate and Delta A, are generated
through exchange rescattering. The correlation of the ratio B(pi^0 pi^0)/B(pi^+
pi^-) and Delta A is studied. Predictions on B_s rates, direct and
time-dependent CP asymmetries are made.
