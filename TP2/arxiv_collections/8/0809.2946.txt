ZnSe nanowire heterostructures were grown by molecular beam epitaxy in the
vapour-liquid-solid growth mode assisted by gold catalysts. Size, shape and
crystal structure are found to strongly depend on the growth conditions. Both,
zinc-blende and wurtzite crystal structures are observed using transmission
electron microscopy. At low growth temperature, cone-shaped nano-needles are
formed. For higher growth temperature, the nanowires are uniform and have a
high aspect ratio with sizes of 1-2 $\mu$m in length and 20-50 nm in width as
observed by scanning electron microscopy. Growing a nanowire on top of a
nano-needle allows us to obtain very narrow nanorods with a diameter less than
10 nm and a low density of stacking fault defects. These results allow us the
insertion of CdSe quantum dots in a ZnSe nanowire. An effcient photon
anti-bunching was observed up to 220 K, demonstrating a high-temperature
single-photon source.
