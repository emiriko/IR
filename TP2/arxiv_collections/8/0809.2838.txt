We show that the essential physics of the Hanbury Brown-Twiss (HBT) and the
thermal light ghost imaging experiments is the same, i.e., due to the intensity
fluctuations of the thermal light. However, in the ghost imaging experiments, a
large number of bits information needs to be treated together, whereas in the
HBT there is only one bit information required to be obtained. In the HBT
experiment far field is used for the purpose of easy detection, while in the
ghost image experiment near (or not-far) field is used for good quality image.
