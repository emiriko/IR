The issue of how superconductivity originate in the $CuO_2$ planes believed
to be crucial to understanding the high $T_c$ superconducting cuprates is still
an going debate. In the wake of recent experimental observations of the the
Zhang-Rice singlet (ZRS), its formation and propagation need to be revisited
especially by using a simple approach almost at a phenomenological level.
Within a highly simplified correlated variational approach (HSCVA) in this
paper, a new formation of the ZRS as constituting the ground state of a
single-band t-J model of the $CuO_2$ planes is developed. This formation is
then used to demonstrate how the ZRS can be propagated as a probable Cooper
channel in the $CuO_2$ planes.
