We study the influence of the relative size of the reservoir on the
adsorption isotherms of a fluid in disordered or inhomogeneous mesoporous
solids. We consider both an atomistic model of a fluid in a simple, yet
structured pore, whose adsorption isotherms are computed by molecular
simulation, and a coarse-grained model for adsorption in a disordered
mesoporous material, studied by a density functional approach in a local
mean-field approximation. In both cases, the fluid inside the porous solid
exchanges matter with a reservoir of gas that is at the same temperature and
chemical potential and whose relative size can be varied, and the control
parameter is the total number of molecules present in the porous sample and in
the reservoir. Varying the relative sizes of the reservoir and the sample may
change the shape of the hysteretic isotherms, leading to a "reentrant" behavior
compared to the grand-canonical isotherm when the latter displays a jump in
density. We relate these phenomena to the organization of the metastable states
that are accessible for the adsorbed fluid at a given chemical potential or
density.
