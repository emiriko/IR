We reformulate nested relations between off-shell
$U_q(\widehat{\mathfrak{gl}}_N)$ Bethe vectors as a certain equation on
generating series of strings of the composed $U_q(\widehat{\mathfrak{gl}}_N)$
currents. Using inversion of the generating series we find a new type of
hierarchical relations between universal off-shell Bethe vectors, useful for a
derivation of Bethe equation. As an example of application, we use these
relations for a derivation of analytical Bethe ansatz equations [Arnaudon D. et
al., Ann. Henri Poincar\'e 7 (2006), 1217-1268, math-ph/0512037] for the
parameters of universal Bethe vectors of the algebra
$U_q(\widehat{\mathfrak{gl}}_2)$.
