A new approach is developed to calculate temperature dependent Seebeck
coefficient of heavily doped systems by using Boltzmann transport theory and
electron density of states (DOS) obtained from density functional calculations.
This approach is applied to heavily doped La:STO with DOS from tetrahedral
method and Fermi energy using Fermi integrals. The calculated Seebeck
coefficient agrees with the experimental data nearly quantitatively, which
proved the accuracy of this approach. The influence of the Fermi energy and
asymmetry of DOS on the Seebeck coefficient is analyzed.
