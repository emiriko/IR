We study the problem of testing composite hypotheses versus composite
alternatives, using a convex duality approach. In contrast to classical results
obtained by Krafft and Witting (Z. Wahrsch. Verw. Gebiete 7 (1967) 289--302),
where sufficient optimality conditions are derived via Lagrange duality, we
obtain necessary and sufficient optimality conditions via Fenchel duality under
compactness assumptions. This approach also differs from the methodology
developed in Cvitani\'{c} and Karatzas (Bernoulli 7 (2001) 79--97).
