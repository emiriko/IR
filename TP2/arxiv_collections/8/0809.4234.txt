We derive the spectra of the D_N-type Calogero (rational) su(m) spin model,
including the degeneracy factors of all energy levels. By taking the strong
coupling limit of this model, in which its spin and dynamical degrees of
freedom decouple, we compute the exact partition function of the su(m)
Polychronakos-Frahm spin chain of D_N type. With the help of this partition
function we study several statistical properties of the chain's spectrum, such
as the density of energy levels and the distribution of spacings between
consecutive levels.
