The interplay of electron-phonon (el-ph) and electron-electron (el-el)
interactions in epitaxial graphene is studied by directly probing its
electronic structure. We found a strong coupling of electrons to the soft part
of the A1g phonon evident by a kink at 150+/-15 meV, while the coupling of
electrons to another expected phonon E2g at 195 meV can only be barely
detected. The possible role of the el-el interaction to account for the
enhanced coupling of electrons to the A1g phonon, and the contribution of el-ph
interaction to the linear imaginary part of the self energy at high binding
energy are also discussed. Our results reveal the dominant role of the A1g
phonon in the el-ph interaction in graphene, and highlight the important
interplay of el-el and el-ph interactions in the self energy of graphene.
