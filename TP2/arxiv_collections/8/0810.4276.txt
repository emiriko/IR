This paper is the write-up version of the theory summary talk given at the
HSQCD 2008 Workshop in Gatchina, Russia. Recent theoretical developments and
results are summarized focusing on works that point out new perspectives,
ranging from perturbative QCD, DGLAP and ERBL evolution, polarized and
unpolarized parton distribution functions, small-x physics to nonperturbative
QCD, lattice simulations, quark-gluon matter, hadron spectroscopy, and
predictions for the LHC.
