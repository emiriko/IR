We demonstrate that entanglement can persistently recur in an oscillating
two-spin molecule that is coupled to a hot and noisy environment, in which no
static entanglement can survive. The system represents a non-equilibrium
quantum system which, driven through the oscillatory motion, is prevented from
reaching its (separable) thermal equilibrium state. Environmental noise,
together with the driven motion, plays a constructive role by periodically
resetting the system, even though it will destroy entanglement as usual. As a
building block, the present simple mechanism supports the perspective that
entanglement can exist also in systems which are exposed to a hot environment
and to high levels of de-coherence, which we expect e.g. for biological
systems. Our results furthermore suggest that entanglement plays a role in the
heat exchange between molecular machines and environment. Experimental
simulation of our model with trapped ions is within reach of the current
state-of-the-art quantum technologies.
