Monte Carlo simulation using a combination of Wang Landau (WL) and Transition
Matrix (TM) Monte Carlo algorithms to simulate two lattice spin models with
continuous energy is described. One of the models, the one dimensional
Lebwohl-Lasher model has an exact solution and we have used this to test the
performance of the mixed algorithm (WLTM). The other system we have worked on
is the two dimensional XY-model. The purpose of the present work is to test the
performance of the WLTM algorithm in continuous models and to suggest methods
for obtaining best results in such systems using this algorithm.
