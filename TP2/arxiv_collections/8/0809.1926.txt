The formation and dissociation of specific noncovalent interactions between a
variety of macromolecules play a crucial role in the function of biological
systems. During the last few years, three main lines of research led to a
dramatic improvement of our understanding of these important phenomena. First,
combination of genetic engineering and X ray cristallography made available a
simultaneous knowledg of the precise structure and affinity of series or
related ligand-receptor systems differing by a few well-defined atoms. Second,
improvement of computer power and simulation techniques allowed extended
exploration of the interaction of realistic macromolecules. Third, simultaneous
development of a variety of techniques based on atomic force microscopy,
hydrodynamic flow, biomembrane probes, optical tweezers, magnetic fields or
flexible transducers yielded direct experimental information of the behavior of
single ligand receptor bonds. At the same time, investigation of well defined
cellular models raised the interest of biologists to the kinetic and mechanical
properties of cell membrane receptors. The aim of this review is to give a
description of these advances that benefitted from a largely multidisciplinar
approach.
