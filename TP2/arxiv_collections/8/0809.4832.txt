In a class of AMSB models, the splitting in the Wino multiplet turns out to
be very small, such as the often-quoted 170 MeV in minimal AMSB, which
originates from MSSM loops. Such a small mass gap is potentially a window into
higher scale physics, as it may be sensitive to higher-dimensional operators.
We show that still within AMSB one can get a much larger splitting in the Wino
multiplet--a few GeV--if the scale of the new physics is comparable to the
gravitino mass (which is indeed often the scale of new physics in anomaly
mediation).
