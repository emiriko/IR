Periodic neural activity not locked to the stimulus or to motor responses is
usually ignored. Here, we present new tools for modeling and quantifying the
information transmission based on periodic neural activity that occurs with
quasi-random phase relative to the stimulus. We propose a model to reproduce
characteristic features of oscillatory spike trains, such as histograms of
inter-spike intervals and phase locking of spikes to an oscillatory influence.
The proposed model is based on an inhomogeneous Gamma process governed by a
density function that is a product of the usual stimulus-dependent rate and a
quasi-periodic function. Further, we present an analysis method generalizing
the direct method (Rieke et al, 1999; Brenner et al, 2000) to assess the
information content in such data. We demonstrate these tools on recordings from
relay cells in the lateral geniculate nucleus of the cat.
