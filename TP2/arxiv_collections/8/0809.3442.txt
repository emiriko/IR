We consider the possibility that Lorentz violation can generate differences
between the limiting velocities of light and charged matter. Such effects would
lead to efficient vacuum Cherenkov radiation or rapid photon decay. The absence
of such effects for 104.5 GeV electrons at the Large Electron Positron collider
and for 300 GeV photons at the Tevatron therefore constrains this type of
Lorentz breakdown. Within the context of the standard-model extension, these
ideas imply an experimental bound at the level of -5.8 x 10^{-12} <=
\tilde{\kappa}_{tr}-(4/3)c_e^{00} <= 1.2 x 10^{-11} tightening existing
laboratory measurements by 3-4 orders of magnitude. Prospects for further
improvements with terrestrial and astrophysical methods are discussed.
