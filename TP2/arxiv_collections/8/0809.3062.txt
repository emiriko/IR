This work explores the possibility of controlling the dissociation of a
monochromatically driven one-dimensional Morse oscillator by recreating
barriers, in the form of invariant tori with irrational winding ratios, at
specific locations in the phase space. The control algorithm proposed by Huang
{\it et al.} (Phys. Rev. A {\bf 74}, 053408 (2006)) is used to obtain an
analytic expression for the control field. We show that the control term,
approximated as an additional weaker field, is efficient in recreating the
desired tori and suppresses the classical as well as the quantum dissociation.
However, in the case when the field frequency is tuned close to a two-photon
resonance the local barriers are not effective in suppressing the dissociation.
We establish that in the on-resonant case quantum dissociation primarily occurs
via resonance-assisted tunneling and controlling the quantum dynamics requires
a local perturbation of the specific nonlinear resonance in the underlying
phase space.
