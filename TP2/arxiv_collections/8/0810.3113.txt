By exploiting photo-induced reorientation in azo-polymer thin films, we
demonstrate all-optical polarization-encoded information storage with a
scanning near-field optical microscope. In the writing routine, 5-level bits
are created by associating different bit values to different birefringence
directions, induced in the polymer after illumination with linearly polarized
light. The reading routine is then performed by implementing
polarization-modulation techniques on the same near-field microscope, in order
to measure the encoded birefringence direction.
