The dynamical-mean-field method is applied to investigate the transport
properties of heterostructures consisting of a strongly-correlated electron
system connected to metallic leads. The spectral function inside the correlated
region is sensitive to the change of the interaction strength and bias voltage.
Because of this sensitivity, current vs voltage characteristics of such
heterostructures are rather nonlinear regardless of the detail of the potential
profile inside the correlated region. The electronic properties such as the
double occupancy are also changed by the bias voltage.
