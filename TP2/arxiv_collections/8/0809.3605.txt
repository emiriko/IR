The H1 and Zeus collaborations have measured the inclusive diffractive DIS
cross section ep -> eXp and these measurements are in good agreement within a
normalisation uncertainty. Diffractive parton density functions (DPDFs) have
been extracted from NLO QCD fits to inclusive measurements of diffractive DIS
and the predictions of these DPDFs are compared with measurements of
diffractive dijets in DIS, testing the validity of the factorisation
approximations used in their extraction. H1 then use these diffractive dijets
in DIS data to provide further constraints in a combined QCD fit, resulting in
the next generation of DPDFs which have constrained the diffractive gluon at
large momentum fractions. Finally, the predictions of DPDFs are compared to
diffractive dijets in photoproduction where the issue of survival probability
in a hadron-hadron environment can be studied.
