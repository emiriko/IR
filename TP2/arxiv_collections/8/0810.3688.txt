We explore various extensions of computational packages such as Feynarts and
FormCalc in application to calculation of the electron-proton scattering
asymmetries relevant to the G0 and QWeak experiments. Our calculations where
completed up to the Next-to-the-Leading-Order (one-loop) using the dipole form
factor in hadronic vertices. We saw no significant difference between monopole
and dipole type of asymmetry over the range of Q^2 = 0.1 - 1.0 GeV^2. Our
results are in the good agreement with theoretical predictions by the G0
collaboration, but show discrepancy from the experiment. This discrepancy from
the experimental results is due to the strange content of the proton and
possibly new physics as well.
