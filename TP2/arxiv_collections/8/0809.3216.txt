A manifestly supersymmetric nonperturbative matrix regularization for a
twisted version of N=(8,8) theory on a curved background (a two-sphere) is
constructed. Both continuum and the matrix regularization respect four exact
scalar supersymmetries under a twisted version of the supersymmetry algebra. We
then discuss a succinct Q=1 deformed matrix model regularization of N=4 SYM in
d=4, which is equivalent to a non-commutative $A_4^*$ orbifold lattice
formulation. Motivated by recent progress in supersymmetric lattices, we also
propose a N=1/4 supersymmetry preserving deformation of N=4 SYM theory on
$\R^4$. In this class of N=1/4 theories, both the regularized and continuum
theory respect the same set of (scalar) supersymmetry. By using the equivalence
of the deformed matrix models with the lattice formulations, we give a very
simple physical argument on why the exact lattice supersymmetry must be a
subset of scalar subalgebra. This argument disagrees with the recent claims of
the link approach, for which we give a new interpretation.
