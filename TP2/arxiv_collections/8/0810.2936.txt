Manipulation of sudden death of entanglement (ESD) of two qubits interacting
with statistically uncorrelated thermal reservoirs is investigated. It is shown
that for initially prepared X-states of the two qubits a simple (necessary and
sufficient) criterion for ESD can be derived with the help of the
Peres-Horodecki criterion. This criterion implies that, in contrast to the
zero-temperature case, at finite temperature of at least one of the reservoirs
all initially prepared two-qubit X-states exhibit ESD. General conditions are
derived under which ESD can be hastened, delayed, or averted.
