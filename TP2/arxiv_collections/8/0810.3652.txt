A review is presented of the current experimental status of the top quark
sector of the standard model. The measurements summarized include searches for
electroweak single top production, the latest results on the ttbar production
cross section, and searches for new physics in top quark production and decay.
In addition, the recent measurement of the top quark mass to a precision of
0.7% is highlighted
