We investigate spin currents and spin-current correlations for double quantum
dots in the spin blockade regime. By analysing the time evolution of the
density matrix, we obtain the spin resolved currents and derive from a
generating function an expression for the fluctuations and correlations. Both
the charge current and the spin current turn out to be generally
super-Poissonian. Moreover, we study the influence of ac fields acting upon the
transported electrons. In particular, we focus on fields that cause spin
rotation or photon-assisted tunnelling.
