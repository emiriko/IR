A method is proposed in this paper to construct a new extended q-deformed KP
($q$-KP) hiearchy and its Lax representation. This new extended $q$-KP
hierarchy contains two types of q-deformed KP equation with self-consistent
sources, and its two kinds of reductions give the q-deformed Gelfand-Dickey
hierarchy with self-consistent sources and the constrained q-deformed KP
hierarchy, which include two types of q-deformed KdV equation with sources and
two types of q-deformed Boussinesq equation with sources. All of these results
reduce to the classical ones when $q$ goes to 1. This provides a general way to
construct (2+1)- and (1+1)-dimensional q-deformed soliton equations with
sources and their Lax representations.
