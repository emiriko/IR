We develop a stochastic, individual-based model for food web simulation which
in the large-population limit reduces to the well-studied Webworld model, which
has been used to successfully construct model food webs with several realistic
features. We demonstrate that an almost exact match is found between the
population dynamics in fixed food webs, and that the demographic fluctuations
have systematic effects when the new model is used to construct food webs due
to the presence of species with small populations.
