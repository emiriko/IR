It is shown that in the complex trajectory representation of quantum
mechanics, the Born's Psi^{\star}\Psi probability density can be obtained from
the imaginary part of the velocity field of particles on the real axis.
Extending this probability axiom to the complex plane, we first attempt to find
a probability density by solving an appropriate conservation equation. The
characteristic curves of this conservation equation are found to be the same as
the complex paths of particles in the new representation. The boundary
condition in this case is that the extended probability density should agree
with the quantum probability rule along the real line. For the simple,
time-independent, one-dimensional problems worked out here, we find that a
conserved probability density can be derived from the velocity field of
particles, except in regions where the trajectories were previously suspected
to be nonviable. An alternative method to find this probability density in
terms of a trajectory integral, which is easier to implement on a computer and
useful for single particle solutions, is also presented. Most importantly, we
show, by using the complex extension of Schrodinger equation, that the desired
conservation equation can be derived from this definition of probability
density.
