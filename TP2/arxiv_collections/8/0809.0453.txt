We consider a one-dimensional harmonic crystal with conservative noise, in
contact with two stochastic Langevin heat baths at different temperatures. The
noise term consists of collisions between neighbouring oscillators that
exchange their momenta, with a rate $\gamma$. The stationary equations for the
covariance matrix are exactly solved in the thermodynamic limit ($N\to\infty$).
In particular, we derive an analytical expression for the temperature profile,
which turns out to be independent of $\gamma$. Moreover, we obtain an exact
expression for the leading term of the energy current, which scales as
$1/\sqrt{\gamma N}$. Our theoretical results are finally found to be consistent
with the numerical solutions of the covariance matrix for finite $N$.
