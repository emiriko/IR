In this work we investigated correlations between the internal microstructure
and sample size (lateral as well as thickness) of mesoscopic, tens of nanometer
thick graphite (multigraphene) samples and the temperature $(T)$ and field
$(B)$ dependence of their electrical resistivity $\rho(T,B)$. Low energy
transmission electron microscopy reveals that the original highly oriented
pyrolytic graphite material -- from which the multigraphene samples were
obtained by exfoliation -- is composed of a stack of $\sim 50 $nm thick and
micrometer long crystalline regions separated by interfaces running parallel to
the graphene planes. We found a qualitative and quantitative change in the
behavior of $\rho(T,B)$ upon thickness of the multigraphene samples, indicating
that their internal microstructure is important.} {The overall results indicate
that the metallic-like behavior of $\rho(T)$ at zero field measured for bulk
graphite samples is not intrinsic of ideal graphite. The results suggest that
the interfaces between crystalline regions may be responsible for the
superconducting-like properties observed in graphite. Our transport
measurements also show that reducing the sample lateral size as well as the
length between voltage electrodes decreases the magnetoresistance, in agreement
with recently published results. The magnetoresistance of the multigraphene
samples shows a scaling of the form ($(R(B) - R(0))/R(0))/T^\alpha = f(B/T)$
with a sample dependent exponent $\alpha \sim 1$, which applies in the whole
temperature 2 K $\le T \le 270$K and magnetic field range $B \le 8 $T.
