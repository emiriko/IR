We report on a study of Gilbert damping due to particle-hole pair excitations
in conducting ferromagnets. We focus on a toy two-band model and on a four-band
spherical model which provides an approximate description of ferromagnetic
(Ga,Mn)As. These models are sufficiently simple that disorder-ladder-sum vertex
corrections to the long-wavelength spin-spin response function can be summed to
all orders. An important objective of this study is to assess the reliability
of practical approximate expressions which can be combined with electronic
structure calculations to estimate Gilbert damping in more complex systems.
