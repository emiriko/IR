The following result was announced in the earlier version(s) of this paper:
On weakly compactly generated Banach spaces which admit a Lipschitz, C^{p}
smooth bump function, one can uniformly approximate uniformly continuous,
bounded, real-valued functions by Lipschitz, C^{p} smooth functions.
Unfortunately, there is a gap in the proof which renders the proof in its
present form incorrect
