The Large Hadron Collider, LHC, though meant for discovery, will provide
enough data from early phase to also perform various studies of Standard Model
processes in as yet unexplored kinematic regions. Precision measurements of the
electroweak variables will be possible due to the large rates of W and Z boson
productions combined with clean leptonic signatures. Examples of simulation
results from CMS and ATLAS collaboration studies are presented to show the wide
variety of measurements possible and how various issues like background
estimation, determination of systematic effects will be taken care of by the
experiments.
