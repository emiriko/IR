In this paper, we compare the dispersion relations of hard thermal loop and
complete one loop. It is shown that in the dynamical screening regime, the
completely one-loop calculation presents a prominent threshold frequency, below
which no pure imaginary mode survives. This phenomenon is responsible for the
oscillatory static in-medium potential and ultimately results in a damping
oscillation of the radial distribution function. We consider this typical shape
is the footprint of liquid QGP.
