Inelastic neutron scattering and reactions on Pb isotopes can result in gamma
rays near the signature endpoint energy in a number of double-beta decay
isotopes. In particular, there are gamma-ray transitions in Pb-206,207,208 that
might produce energy deposits at the 76-Ge Q value in Ge detectors used for
double-beta decay searches. The levels that produce these gamma rays can be
excited by (n,n'gamma) or (n,xngamma) reactions, but the cross sections are
small and previously unmeasured. This work uses the pulsed neutron beam at the
Los Alamos Neutron Science Center to directly measure reactions of interest to
double-beta decay experiments. The cross section on natural Pb to produce the
2041-keV gamma ray from Pb-206 is measured to be 3.6 +/- 0.7 (stat.) +/- 0.3
(syst.) mb at ~9.6 MeV. The cross section on natural Pb to produce the 3062-keV
gamma ray from Pb-207 and Pb-208 is measured to be 3.9 +/- 0.8 (stat.) +/- 0.4
(syst.) mb at the same energy. We report cross sections or place upper limits
on the cross sections for exciting some other levels in Pb that have transition
energies corresponding to Q value in other double-beta decay isotopes.
