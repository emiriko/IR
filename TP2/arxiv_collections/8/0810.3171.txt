New QCD results obtained by the H1 Collaboration are summarized. These
results are based on data taken in $e^{\pm}p$ collisions at HERA I (1994-2002)
and HERA II (2003-2007) corresponding to an integrated luminosity of almost
$\rm 0.5 fb^{-1}$. The data were taken at an electron {Electron means electron
and positron.} beam energy of $E_{e}=27.5$ GeV and proton beam energies of $\rm
E_{p}=820 GeV, 920 GeV, 575 GeV$ and $\rm 460 GeV$. A direct measurement of
$F_{L}$, jet production and measurement of $\alpha_{s}$, production of heavy
quarks and diffractive photo-production of jets are presented.
