We discuss the flavor asymmetry of the nucleon in an unquenched quark model
for baryons in which the effects of quark-antiquark pairs (u anti-u, d anti-d
and s anti-s) are taken into account in an explicit form. It is shown that the
inclusion of q anti-q pairs leads to an excess of anti-d over anti-u quarks in
the proton.
