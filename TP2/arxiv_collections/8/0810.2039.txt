Thermal field theory is applied to particle production rates in inflationary
models, leading to new results for catalysed, or two-stage decay, where massive
fields act as decay channels for the production of light fields. A numerical
investigation of the Bolztmann equation in an expanding universe shows that the
particle distributions produced during small amplitude inflaton oscillations or
alongside slowly moving inflaton fields can thermalise.
