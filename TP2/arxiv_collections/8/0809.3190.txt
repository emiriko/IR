The Christensen-Egan algorithm is extended and generalized to efficiently
evaluate new spin foam vertex amplitudes proposed by Engle, Pereira & Rovelli
and Freidel & Krasnov, with or without (factored) boundary states. A concrete
pragmatic proposal is made for comparing the different models using uniform
methodologies, applicable to the behavior of large spin asymptotics and of
expectation values of specific semiclassical observables. The asymptotics of
the new models exhibit non-oscillatory, power-law decay similar to that of the
Barrett-Crane model, though with different exponents. Also, an analysis of the
semiclassical wave packet propagation problem indicates that the Magliaro,
Rovelli and Perini's conjecture of good semiclassical behavior of the new
models does not hold for generic factored states, which neglect spin-spin
correlations.
