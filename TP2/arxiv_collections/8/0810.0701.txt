The PHENIX experiment presents results from the RHIC 2006 run with polarized
proton collisions at sqrt(s) = 62.4 GeV for inclusive pi^0 production at
mid-rapidity. Unpolarized cross section results are measured for transverse
momenta p_T = 0.5 to 7 GeV/c. Next-to-leading order perturbative quantum
chromodynamics calculations are compared with the data, and while the
calculations are consistent with the measurements, next-to-leading logarithmic
corrections improve the agreement. Double helicity asymmetries A_LL are
presented for p_T = 1 to 4 GeV/c and probe the higher range of Bjorken_x of the
gluon (x_g) with better statistical precision than our previous measurements at
sqrt(s)=200 GeV. These measurements are sensitive to the gluon polarization in
the proton for 0.06 < x_g < 0.4.
