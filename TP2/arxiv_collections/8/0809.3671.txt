The fine-sampling electromagnetic calorimeter prototype has been
experimentally tested using the 1-19 GeV/c tagged beams of negatively charged
particles at the U70 accelerator at IHEP, Protvino. The energy resolution
measured by electrons is Delta{E}/E=2.8%/\sqrt{E} + 1.3%. The position
resolution for electrons is Delta{x}=3.1 + 15.4/sqrt{E} mm in the center of the
cell. The lateral non-uniformity of the prototype energy response to electrons
and MIPs has turned out to be negligible. Obtained experimental results are in
a good agreement with Monte-Carlo simulations.
