Theories with extra dimensions have gained much interest in recent years as
candidates for a possible extension of the SM. The observation of large extra
dimensions through real graviton emission is one of the most popular related
new phenomena. The main experimental signatures from graviton emission are
production of single jet and single photon events, which have been studied in
great detail. This work describes the implementation of graviton production
together with either a Z or a photon in Pythia 8. The potential of using Z plus
graviton production at the LHC as a complementary channel is also studied. For
completeness, this work also includes the more recently proposed scenario of
unparticle emission, since the effective theory of unparticles to some extent
represents a generalization of the large extra dimension model.
