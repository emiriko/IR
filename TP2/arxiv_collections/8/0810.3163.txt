We provide counter-examples to Mulmuley's strong saturation conjecture
(strong SH) for the Kronecker coefficients. This conjecture was proposed in the
setting of Geometric Complexity Theory to show that deciding whether or not a
Kronecker coefficient is zero can be done in polynomial time. We also provide a
short proof of the #P-hardness of computing the Kronecker coefficients. Both
results rely on the connections between the Kronecker coefficients and another
family of structural constants in the representation theory of the symmetric
groups: Murnaghan's reduced Kronecker coefficients.
  An appendix by Mulmuley introduces a relaxed form of the saturation
hypothesis SH, still strong enough for the aims of Geometric Complexity Theory.
