The entanglement entropy of SU(N) lattice gauge theory is studied exactly in
1+1 space-time dimensions and in Migdal-Kadanoff approximation in higher
dimensional space. The existence of a non-analytical behavior reminiscent of a
phase transition for a characteristic size of the entangled region is
demonstrated for higher dimensional theories.
