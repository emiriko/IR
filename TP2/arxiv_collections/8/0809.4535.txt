Any mu^2-divergence is shown analytically to be absent for a class of actions
for Overlap and Domain Wall Fermions with nonzero chemical potential. All such
actions are, however, shown to violate the chiral invariance. While the
parameter M of these actions can be shown to be irrelevant in the continuum
limit, as expected, it is shown numerically that the continuum limit can be
reached with relatively coarser lattices for M in the range of 1.5-1.6.
