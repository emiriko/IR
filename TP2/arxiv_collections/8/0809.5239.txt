We provide numerical evidence that hydrodynamic interactions are screened for
charged polymers in salt solution on time scales below the Zimm time. At very
short times, a crossover to hydrodynamic behavior is observed. Our conclusions
are drawn from extensive coarse-grained computer simulations of
polyelectrolytes in explicit solvent and explicit salt, and discussed in terms
of analytical arguments based on the Debye-Hueckel approximation.
