We present a search for the Standard Model Higgs boson produced in
association with a Z or a W boson, using data collected with the CDF II
detector at the Tevatron accelerator. A scenario where the Z decays into
neutrinos or leptons originating from the W-decay escape detection and the
Higgs decays into a $b\overline{b}$ pair is considered. Therefore the expected
signature is large missing transverse energy ($\etmiss$), no isolated leptons,
and two b-jets. We present the preliminary results in this search using
2.1$fb^{-1}$ of data collected by CDF.
