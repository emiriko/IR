Photo-induced metallic states in a Mott insulator are studied for the
half-filled, one-dimensional Hubbard model with the time-dependent density
matrix renormalization group. An irradiation of strong AC field is found to
create a linear dispersion in the optical spectrum (current-current
correlation) in the nonequilibrium steady state reminiscent of the
Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid for the doped Mott insulator in equilibrium. The spin
spectrum in nonequilibrium retains the des Cloizeaux-Pearson mode with the spin
velocity differing from the charge velocity. The mechanism of the
photocarrier-doping, along with the renormalization in the charge velocity, is
analyzed in terms of an effective Dirac model.
