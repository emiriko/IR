We report the existence, symmetry breaking and other instabilities of dark
polariton-solitons in semiconductor microcavities operating in the strong
coupling regime. These half-light half-matter solitons are potential candidates
for applications in all-optical signal processing. Their excitation time and
required pump powers are a few orders of magnitude less than those of their
weakly coupled light-only counterparts.
