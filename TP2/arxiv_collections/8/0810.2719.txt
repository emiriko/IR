For continuous phase transitions characterized by power-law divergences,
Fisher renormalization prescribes how to obtain the critical exponents for a
system under constraint from their ideal counterparts. In statistical
mechanics, such ideal behaviour at phase transitions is frequently modified by
multiplicative logarithmic corrections. Here, Fisher renormalization for the
exponents of these logarithms is developed in a general manner. As for the
leading exponents, Fisher renormalization at the logarithmic level is seen to
be involutory and the renormalized exponents obey the same scaling relations as
their ideal analogs. The scheme is tested in lattice animals and the Yang-Lee
problem at their upper critical dimensions, where predictions for logarithmic
corrections are made.
