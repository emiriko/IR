The quasiparticles in Quantum Hall liquids carry fractional charge and obey
fractional quantum statistics. Of particular recent interest are those with
non-Abelian statistics, since their braiding properties could in principle be
used for robust coding of quantum information. There is already a good
theoretical understanding of quasiholes both in Abelian and non-Abelian QH
states. Here we develop conformal field theory methods that allow for an
equally precise description of quasielectrons, and explicitly construct two-
and four-quasielectron excitations of the non-Abelian Moore-Read state.
