We construct irreducible graded representations of simply laced
Khovanov-Lauda algebras which are concentrated in one degree. The underlying
combinatorics of skew shapes and standard tableaux corresponding to arbitrary
simply laced types has been developed previously by Peterson, Proctor and
Stembridge. In particular, the Peterson-Proctor hook formula gives dimensions
of the homogeneous irreducible modules corresponding to straight shapes.
