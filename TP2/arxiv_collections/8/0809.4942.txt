In honor of Minkowski's great contribution to Special Relativity, celebrated
at this conference, we first review Wigner's theory of the projective
irreducible representations of the inhomogeneous Lorentz group. We also sketch
those parts of Mackey's mathematical theory on induced representations which
are particularly useful for physicists. As an important application of the
Wigner-Mackey theory, we shall describe in a unified manner free classical and
quantum fields for arbitrary spin, and demonstrate that locality implies the
normal spin-statistics connection.
