We present a comprehensive study of the Bose-Einstein condensate to
Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BEC-BCS) crossover in fermionic $^6$Li using Bragg
spectroscopy. A smooth transition from molecular to atomic spectra is observed
with a clear signature of pairing at and above unitarity. These spectra probe
the dynamic and static structure factors of the gas and provide a direct link
to two-body correlations. We have characterised these correlations and measured
their density dependence across the broad Feshbach resonance at 834 G.
