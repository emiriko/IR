Different theoretical and experimental aspects of electromagnetic phenomena
in media is reviewed. The 100 year old Minkowski theory is in agreement with
most experiments, but has theoretical problems related to its implied validity
in all inertial frames. It is suggested that the similar Abraham theory should
be permanently laid to rest since it is not compatible with basic quantum
mechanics and is in disagreement with most experiments. Recently an effective
field theory has been proposed which avoids these problems by considering the
photon as a quasiparticle like any other excitation in condensed matter physics
for which the rest frame of the medium is a preferred frame. It relates many
different classical and quantum optical phenomena in a unified description.
