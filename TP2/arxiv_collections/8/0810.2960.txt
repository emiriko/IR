The dipole blockade between Rydberg atoms has been proposed as a basic tool
in quantum information processing with neutral atoms. Here we demonstrate
experimentally the Rydberg blockade of two individual atoms separated by 4
$\mu$m. Moreover, we show that, in this regime, the single atom excitation is
enhanced by a collective two-atom behavior associated with the excitation of an
entangled state. This observation is a crucial step towards the deterministic
manipulation of entanglement of two or more atoms using the Rydberg dipole
interaction.
