In the field of Double Beta Decay (DBD) searches the possibility to have high
resolution detectors in which background can be discriminated is very
appealing. This very interesting possibility can be largely fulfilled in the
case of a scintillating bolometer containing a Double Beta Decay emitter whose
transition energy exceeds the one of the natural gamma line of 208Tl. We
present the latest results obtained in the development of such a kind of
scintillating bolometer. For the first time an array of five CdWO4 (116Cd has a
Double Beta Decay transition energy of 2805 keV) crystals is tested. The array
consists of a plane of four 3x3x3 cm3 crystals and a second plane consisting of
a single 3x3x6 cm3 crystal. This setup is mounted in hall C of the National
Laboratory of Gran Sasso inside a lead shielding in order to reduce as far as
possible the environmental background. The aim of this test is to demonstrate
the technical feasibility of this technique through an array of detectors and
perform a long background measurement in the best conditions in order to prove
the achievable background in the Zero neutrino-DBD region.
