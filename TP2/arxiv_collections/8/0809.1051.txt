We present a very efficient solver for the general Anderson impurity problem.
It is based on the perturbation around a solution obtained from exact
diagonalization using a small number of bath sites. We formulate a perturbation
theory which is valid for both weak and strong coupling and interpolates
between these limits. Good agreement with numerically exact quantum Monte-Carlo
results is found for a single bath site over a wide range of parameters. In
particular, the Kondo resonance in the intermediate coupling regime is well
reproduced for a single bath site and the lowest order correction. The method
is particularly suited for low temperatures and alleviates analytical
continuation of imaginary time data due to the absence of statistical noise
compared to quantum Monte-Carlo impurity solvers.
