A coherent terahertz needle radiation emission mechanism is proposed. This
mechanism can be realized in the experiments on femtosecond laser pulses
interacting with surface of nanostructured ferromagnetic metal film. The
proposed mechanism is based on exciting of coupled coherent phonon-magnon modes
on a nanostructured metal surface by laser femtosecond pulse. The value of the
Poynting vector for the terahertz radiation is estimated.
