It is well-known by the work of Hsiang and Kleiner that every closed oriented
positively curved 4-dimensional manifold with an effective isometric S^1-action
is homeomorphic to S^4 or CP^2. As stated, it is a topological classification.
The primary goal of this paper is to show that it is indeed a diffeomorphism
classification for such 4-dimensional manifolds. The proof of this
diffeomorphism classification also shows an even stronger statement that every
positively curved simply connected 4-manifold with an isometric circle action
admits another smooth circle action which extends to a 2-dimensional torus
action and is equivariantly diffeomorphic to a linear action on S^4 or CP^2.
The main strategy is to analyze all possible topological configurations of
effective circle actions on simply connected 4-manifolds by using the so-called
replacement trick of Pao.
