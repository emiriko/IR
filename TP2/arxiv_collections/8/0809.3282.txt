We study ground state properties of periodic Anderson model in a
two-dimensional square lattice with variational Monte Carlo method. It is shown
that there are two different types of quantum phase transition: a conventional
antiferromagnetic transition and a Fermi-surface reconstruction which
accompanies a change of topology of the Fermi surface. The former is induced by
a simple back-folding of the Fermi surface while the latter is induced by
localization of $f$ electrons. The mechanism of these transitions and the
relation to the recent experiments on Fermi surface are discussed in detail.
