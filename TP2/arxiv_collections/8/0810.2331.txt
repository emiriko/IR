I calculate finite-volume effects for three identical spin-1/2 fermions in a
box assuming short-ranged repulsive interactions of `natural size'. This
analysis employs standard perturbation theory in powers of 1/L, where L^3 is
the volume of the box. I give results for the ground states in the A_1, T_1,
and E cubic representations.
