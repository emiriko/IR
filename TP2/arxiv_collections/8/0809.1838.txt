We review spin properties of semiconductor quantum dots and their effect on
optical spectra. Photoluminescence and other types of spectroscopy are used to
probe neutral and charged excitons in individual quantum dots with high
spectral and spatial resolution. Spectral fine structure and polarization
reveal how quantum dot spins interact with each other and with their
environment. By taking advantage of the selectivity of optical selection rules
and spin relaxation, optical spin pumping of the ground state electron and
nuclear spins is achieved. Through such mechanisms, light can be used to
process spins for use as a carrier of information.
