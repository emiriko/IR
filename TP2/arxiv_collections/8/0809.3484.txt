Stochastic processes associated with traveling wave solutions of the
sine-Gordon equation are presented. The structure of the forward Kolmogorov
equation as a conservation law is essential in the construction and so is the
traveling wave structure. The derived stochastic processes are analyzed
numerically. An interpretation of the behaviors of the stochastic processes is
given in terms of the equation of motion.
