We report e+e- --> b anti-b cross section measurements by the BABAR
experiment performed during an energy scan in the range of 10.54 to 11.20 GeV
at the PEP-II e+e- collider. A total relative error of about 5% is reached in
more than three hundred center-of-mass energy steps, separated by about 5 MeV.
These measurements can be used to derive precise information on the parameters
of the Y(10860) and Y(11020) resonances. In particular we show that their
widths may be smaller than previously measured.
