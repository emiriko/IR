We compare MC calculations of the density of states in SU(2) pure gauge
theory with the weak and strong coupling expansions. Surprisingly, the range of
validity of the two approximations overlap significantly, however the large
order behavior of both expansions appear to be similar to the corresponding
expansions of the plaquette. We discuss the implications for the calculation of
the Fisher's zeros of the partition function.
