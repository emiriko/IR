We study the properties of an instanton ensemble in three-flavor dense QCD
which can be regarded as an instanton plasma weakly interacting by exchanging
the eta' mesons. Based on this description, we explore the chiral phase
transition induced by the instanton ensemble at high baryon density in analogy
with the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition. Using the renormalization
group approach, we show that the instanton ensemble always behaves as a
screened and unpaired plasma. We also demonstrate that the chiral condensate in
dense QCD is proportional to the instanton density.
