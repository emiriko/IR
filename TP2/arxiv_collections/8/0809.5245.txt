In the context of warped scenarios in which Standard Model (SM) fields are
allowed to propagate in the bulk, we revisit the possible mixing between the IR
localized Higgs field and the Radion graviscalar. The phenomenology of the
resulting mostly-Higgs field does not suffer important deviations with respect
to the case in which all the SM is localized in the IR brane (original
Higgs-Radion mixing scenario). On the contrary, the phenomenology of the
mostly-Radion field can present important differences with respect to the
original scenario. At the LHC, the most striking effect is now the possibility
of sizeable Radion decays into photons in a mass range well beyond the ZZ and
WW thresholds, not due to dramatically enhanced couplings to photons but to
suppressed couplings to massive fields.
