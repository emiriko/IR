Topological systems, such as fractional quantum Hall liquids, promise to
successfully combat environmental decoherence while performing quantum
computation. These highly correlated systems can support non-Abelian anyonic
quasiparticles that can encode exotic entangled states. To reveal the non-local
character of these encoded states we demonstrate the violation of suitable Bell
inequalities. We provide an explicit recipe for the preparation, manipulation
and measurement of the desired correlations for a large class of topological
models. This proposal gives an operational measure of non-locality for anyonic
states and it opens up the possibility to violate the Bell inequalities in
quantum Hall liquids or spin lattices.
