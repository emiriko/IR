In this letter we construct a new time-periodic solution of the vacuum
Einstein's field equations whose Riemann curvature norm takes the infinity at
some points. We show that this solution is intrinsically time-periodic and
describes a time-periodic universe with the "black hole". New physical
phenomena are investigated and new singularities are analyzed for this
universal model.
