The density functional non-interacting susceptibility has been analyzed in
different phases of CaFe2As2 and compared with similar data for pure d-metals.
The conditions for the "no local moment" itinerant state with large
frustrations are found for the "collapsed" phase (corresponding to
superconducting phase). This itineracy determines the instability versus the
incommensurate magnetic order for the narrow region of wave vectors. For the
ambient pressure phase, the local moments on Fe atoms with much less frustrated
antiferromagnetic interactions are stabilized and a magnetic short or long
range order for all wave vectors is developed.
