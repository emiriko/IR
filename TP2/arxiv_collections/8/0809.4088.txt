The exact solutions of the one-dimensional Klein-Gordon equation for the
Rosen-Morse type potential with equal scalar and vector potentials are
presented. First we briefly review Nikiforov-Uvarov mathematical method. Using
this method, wave-functions and corresponding exact energy equation are
obtained for the s-wave bound state. It has been shown that the results for
Rosen-Morse type potentials reduce to standard Rosen-Morse well and Eckart
potentials in the special case. The PT-symmetry for these potentials is also
considered.
