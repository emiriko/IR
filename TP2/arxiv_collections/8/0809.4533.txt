We numerically investigate the properties of speckle patterns formed by
nonlinear point scatterers. We show that, in the weak localization regime,
dynamical instability appears, eventually leading to chaotic behavior of the
system. Analysing the statistical properties of the instability thresholds for
different values of the system size and disorder strength, a scaling law is
emphasized. The later is also found to govern the smallest decay rate of the
linear system, putting thus forward the crucial importance of interference
effects. This is also underlined by the fact that coherent backscattering is
still observed even in the chaotic regime.
