In the first part of the paper we present a classification of fake lens
spaces of dimension >= 5 whose fundamental group is the cyclic group of order N
>= 2. The classification uses and extends the results of Wall and others in the
case N = 2 and N odd and the results of the authors of the present paper in the
case N a power of 2.
  In the second part we study the suspension map between the simple structure
sets of lens spaces of different dimensions. As an application we obtain an
inductive geometric description of the torsion invariants of fake lens spaces.
