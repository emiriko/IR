We consider the problem of sparse signal recovery from a small number of
random projections (measurements). This is a well known NP-hard to solve
combinatorial optimization problem. A frequently used approach is based on
greedy iterative procedures, such as the Matching Pursuit (MP) algorithm. Here,
we discuss a fast GPU implementation of the MP algorithm, based on the recently
released NVIDIA CUDA API and CUBLAS library. The results show that the GPU
version is substantially faster (up to 31 times) than the highly optimized CPU
version based on CBLAS (GNU Scientific Library).
