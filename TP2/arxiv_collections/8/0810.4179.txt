Recently, it was shown that the amoeba-like cell {\it Physarum polycephalum}
when exposed to a pattern of periodic environmental changes learns and adapts
its behavior in anticipation of the next stimulus to come. Here we show that
such behavior can be mapped into the response of a simple electronic circuit
consisting of an $LC$ contour and a memory-resistor (a memristor) to a train of
voltage pulses that mimic environment changes. We also identify a possible
biological origin of the memristive behavior in the cell. These biological
memory features are likely to occur in other unicellular as well as
multicellular organisms, albeit in different forms. Therefore, the above
memristive circuit model, which has learning properties, is useful to better
understand the origins of primitive intelligence.
