In this paper, we study anisotropic spheres built from known static spherical
solutions. In particular, we are interested in the physical consequences of a
"small" departure from a physically sensible configuration. The obtained
solutions smoothly depend on free parameters. By setting these parameters to
zero, the starting seed solution is regained. We apply our procedure in detail
by taking as seed solutions the Florides metrics, and the Tolman IV solution.
We show that the chosen Tolman IV, and also Heint IIa Durg IV,V perfect fluid
solutions, can be used to generate a class of parametric solutions where the
anisotropic factor has features recalling boson stars. This is an indication
that boson stars could emerge by "perturbing" appropriately a perfect fluid
solution (at least for the seed metrics considered). Finally, starting with
Tolman IV, Heint IIa and Durg IV,V solutions, we build anisotropic
gravastar-like sources with the appropriate boundary conditions.
