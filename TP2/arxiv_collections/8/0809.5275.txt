Discrete multitone modulation (DMT) systems exploit the capabilities of
orthogonal subcarriers to cope efficiently with narrowband interference, high
frequency attenuations and multipath fadings with the help of simple
equalization filters. Adaptive linear precoded discrete multitone (LP-DMT)
system is based on classical DMT, combined with a linear precoding component.
In this paper, we investigate the bit and energy allocation algorithm of an
adaptive LP-DMT system taking into account the channel coding scheme. A coded
adaptive LPDMT system is presented in the power line communication (PLC)
context with a loading algorithm which accommodates the channel coding gains in
bit and energy calculations. The performance of a concatenated channel coding
scheme, consisting of an inner Wei's 4-dimensional 16-states trellis code and
an outer Reed-Solomon code, in combination with the proposed algorithm is
analyzed. Theoretical coding gains are derived and simulation results are
presented for a fixed target bit error rate in a multicarrier scenario under
power spectral density constraint. Using a multipath model of PLC channel, it
is shown that the proposed coded adaptive LP-DMT system performs better than
coded DMT and can achieve higher throughput for PLC applications.
