We have used an electromigration technique to fabricate a $\rm{C_{{60}}}$
single-molecule transistor (SMT). Besides describing our electromigration
procedure, we focus and present an experimental study of a single molecule
quantum dot containing an even number of electrons, revealing, for two
different samples, a clear out-of-equilibrium Kondo effect. Low temperature
magneto-transport studies are provided, which demonstrates a Zeeman splitting
of the finite bias anomaly.
