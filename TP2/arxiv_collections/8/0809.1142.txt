In this article, we consider `$N$'spherical caps of area $4\pi p$ were
uniformly distributed over the surface of a unit sphere. We are giving the
strong threshold function for the size of random caps to cover the surface of a
unit sphere. We have shown that for large $N,$ if $\frac{Np}{\log\:N} > 1/2$
the surface of sphere is completely covered by the $N$ caps almost surely, and
if $\frac{Np}{\log\:N} \leq 1/2$ a partition of the surface of sphere is
remains uncovered by the $N$ caps almost surely.
