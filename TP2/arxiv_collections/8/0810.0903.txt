The underlying mechanism of the stationary light pulse (SLP) was identified
as a band gap being created by a Bragg grating formed by two
counter-propagating coupling fields of similar wavelength. Here we present a
more general view of the formation of SLPs, namely several balanced four-wave
mixing processes sharing the same ground-state coherence. Utilizing this new
concept we report the first experimental observation of a bichromatic SLP at
wavelengths for which no Bragg grating can be established. We also demonstrate
the production of a SLP directly from a propagating light pulse without prior
storage. Being easily controlled externally makes SLPs a very versatile tool
for low-light-level nonlinear optics and quantum information manipulation.
