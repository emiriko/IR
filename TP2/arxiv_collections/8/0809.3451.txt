Theories beyond the Standard Model must necessarily respect its gauge
symmetry. This implies strict constraints on the possible models of
non-standard neutrino interactions, which we analyze. The focus is set on the
effective low-energy dimension six and eight operators involving four leptons,
decomposing them according to all possible tree-level mediators, as a guide for
model building. The new couplings are required to have sizeable strength, while
processes involving four charged leptons are required to be suppressed. For
non-standard interactions in matter, only diagonal tau-neutrino interactions
can escape these requirements and can be allowed to result from dimension six
operators. Large non-standard neutrino interactions from dimension eight
operators alone are phenomenologically allowed in all flavour channels and
shown to require at least two new mediator particles. The new couplings must
obey general cancellation conditions both at the dimension six and eight
levels, which result from expressing the operators obtained from the mediator
analysis in terms of a complete basis of operators. We illustrate with one
example how to apply this information to model building.
