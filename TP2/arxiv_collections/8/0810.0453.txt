Using a simple tight-binding model, we compare the limitations of the
tunnelling predictions coming out of the complex band structure of a
semiconductor with the output of thin film calculations done for the same
semiconducting spacer but considering it to be of finite width, and sandwiched
by metallic electrodes. The comparison is made as a function of spacer width
and interfacial roughness.
