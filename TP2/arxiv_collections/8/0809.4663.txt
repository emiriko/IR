We calculate the bulk viscosity of the massive pion gas within Unitarized
Chiral Perturbation Theory. We obtain a low temperature peak arising from
explicit conformal breaking due to the pion mass and another peak near the
critical temperature, dominated by the conformal anomaly through gluon
condensate terms. The correlation between bulk viscosity and conformal breaking
supports a recent QCD proposal. We discuss the role of resonances, heavier
states and large-$N_c$ counting.
