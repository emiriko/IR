We analyze a discretization method for solving nonlinear integral equations
that contain multiple integrals. These equations include integral equations
with a Volterra series, instead of a single integral term, on one side of the
equation. We prove existence and uniqueness of solutions, and convergence and
estimates of the order of convergence for the numerical methods of solution.
