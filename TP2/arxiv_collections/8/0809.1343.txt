The linking and writhing numbers are key quantities when characterizing the
structure of a piece of supercoiled DNA. Defined as double integrals over the
shape of the double-helix, these numbers are not always straightforward to
compute, though a simplified formula exists. We examine the range of
applicability of this widely-used simplified formula, and show that it cannot
be employed for plectonemic DNA. We show that inapplicability is due to a
hypothesis of Fuller theorem that is not met. The hypothesis seems to have been
overlooked in many works.
