We summarize the structure of N=2 multi-instanton and string loop corrections
to the K\"ahler potential and the gauge kinetic function in type I toroidal
orbifold models. For that aim, we exploit perturbative calculations of the
physical gauge couplings on the heterotic dual, whenever such a perturbative
description is available.
