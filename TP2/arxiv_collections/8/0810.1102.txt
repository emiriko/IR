Effect of uniaxially-deformed aerogel on orientation of the order parameter
of superfluid $^3He$ is considered. Approach used takes into account
correlations in positions of particles forming aerogel. Calculations show that
for the case of the B-like phase in the uniaxially-stretched aerogel
deformation on the order of $10^{-2}\div10^{-4}$ is already strong enough to
achieve orientation of the order parameter which is different from that
required by magnetic field in bulk liquid. For the A-like phase in
uniaxially-squeezed aerogel the order of magnitude of the orientational effect
is estimated. It is shown that the correlations in positions of particles
forming aerogel has stronger effect on the orientation of the order parameter
than on the transition temperature.
