To develop silicon-based spintronic devices, we have explored high-quality
ferromagnetic Fe$_{3}$Si/silicon (Si) structures. Using low-temperature
molecular beam epitaxy at 130 $^circ$C, we realize epitaxial growth of
ferromagnetic Fe$_{3}$Si layers on Si (111) with keeping an abrupt interface,
and the grown Fe$_{3}$Si layer has the ordered $DO_{3}$ phase. Measurements of
magnetic and electrical properties for the Fe$_{3}$Si/Si(111) yield a magnetic
moment of ~ 3.16 $mu_{B}$/f.u. at room temperature and a rectifying
Schottky-diode behavior with the ideality factor of ~ 1.08, respectively.
