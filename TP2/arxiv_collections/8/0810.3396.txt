How to account for the matter predominance of our Universe is a fundamental
issue at the core of our existence. One condition is CP violation, but the
Standard Model falls short by more than $10^{-10}$. Taking cue from a recent
result from the $B$ factories, we find that a fourth quark generation can
provide enhancement by a factor of $10^{13}$ or more. This could be the source
of CP violation for the baryon asymmetry of the Universe. The main source of
enhancement is the large Yukawa couplings of the heavy $t^\prime$ and
$b^\prime$ quarks. With indications for a new, large CP violating phase
$\sin2\Phi_{B_s}$ emerging at the Tevatron, our suggestion can be verified or
refuted at the LHC in the next few years.
