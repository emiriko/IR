40Ca+40,48Ca,46Ti reactions at 25 MeV/A have been studied using the 4p
CHIMERA detector. An isospin effect on the competition between incomplete
fusion and dissipative binary reaction mechanisms has been observed. The
probability of producing a compound system is observed to be lower in the case
of N=Z colliding systems as compared to the case of reactions induced on the
more neutron rich 48Ca target. Predictions based on CoMD-II calculations show
that the competition between fusion-like and dissipative reactions, for the
selected centrality, can strongly constraint the parameterization of symmetry
energy and its density dependence in the nuclear equation of state.
