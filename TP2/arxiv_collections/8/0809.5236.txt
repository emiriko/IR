According to Susskind, a string falling toward a black hole spreads
exponentially over the stretched horizon due to repulsive interactions of the
string bits. In this paper such a string is modeled as a self-avoiding walk and
the string entropy is found. It is shown that the rate at which
information/entropy contained in the string spreads is the maximum rate allowed
by quantum theory. The maximum rate at which the black hole entropy can
increase when a string falls into a black hole is also discussed.
