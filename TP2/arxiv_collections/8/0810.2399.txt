The spin-statistics connection is derived in a simple manner under the
postulates that the original and the exchange wave functions are simply added,
and that the azimuthal phase angle, which defines the orientation of the spin
part of each single-particle spin-component eigenfunction in the plane normal
to the spin-quantization axis, is exchanged along with the other parameters.
The spin factor (-1)^2s belongs to the exchange wave function when this
function is constructed so as to get the spinor ambiguity under control. This
is achieved by effecting the exchange of the azimuthal angle by means of
rotations and admitting only rotations in one sense. The procedure works in
Galilean as well as in Lorentz-invariant quantum mechanics. Relativistic
quantum field theory is not required.
