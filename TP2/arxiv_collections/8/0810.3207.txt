We combined adaptive closed-loop optimization, phase-shaping with a
restricted search space and imaging to control dynamics and decipher the
optimal pulse. The approach was applied to controlling the amplitude of CO$_2$
bending vibration during strong-field Coulomb explosion. The search space was
constrained by expressing the spectral phase as a Taylor series, which
generated pulses with characteristics commensurate with the natural physical
features of this problem. Optimal pulses were obtained that enhanced bending by
up to 56% relative to what is observed with comparably intense, transform
limited pulses. We show that (1) this judicious choice of a reduced parameter
set made unwrapping the dynamics more transparent and (2) the enhancement is
consistent with field-induced structural changes to a bent excited state of
CO$_2^{2+}$, which theoretical simulations have identified as the state from
which the explosion originates.
