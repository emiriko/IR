In multiquark correlator analyses with 1/Nc classifications, it is possible
to separate the scattering background and to justify the factorization of
condensates, which allows us to achieve an isolated peak saturation in the QCD
sum rules for multiquark currents. Then we can extract leading Nc properties of
the ground state. An application to the sigma meson is demonstrated.
