We present measurements of time-dependent CP violation parameters in B0 -->
K0 PI0, B0 --> Ks Pi+ Pi- and B0 --> Ks K+ K- decays. The latter two are
extracted using time-dependent Dalitz plot analyses. These results are obtained
from a large data sample that contains 657 x 10^6 BBbar pairs collected at the
Upsilon(4S) resonance with the Belle detector at the KEKB asymmetric-energy
e+e- collider.
