We determine the voltage generated by a field-driven domain wall, taking into
account non-adiabatic corrections to the motive force induced by the
time-dependent spin Berry phase. Both the diffusive and ballistic transport
regimes are considered. We find that that the non-adiabatic corrections,
together with the contributions due to spin relaxation, determine the voltage
for driving fields smaller than the Walker breakdown limit.
