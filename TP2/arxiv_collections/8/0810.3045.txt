During the last few years there has been a renaissance in charm and
charmonium spectroscopy with higher precision measurements at the $\psi^{'}$
and $\psi(3770)$ coming from BESII and CLEOc and many new discoveries coming
from B-factories. In this paper, I review some new results on "classical"
charmonium and $e^+ e^- \to$ hadrons using B-factory Initial State Radiation
and two photon events.
