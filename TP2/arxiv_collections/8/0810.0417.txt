On a dense energy grid reaching up to 75 meV electron collision energy the
fragmentation angle and the kinetic energy release of neutral dissociative
recombination fragments have been studied in a twin merged beam experiment. The
anisotropy described by Legendre polynomials and the extracted rotational state
contributions were found to vary on a likewise narrow energy scale as the
rotationally averaged rate coefficient. For the first time angular dependences
higher than 2$^{nd}$ order could be deduced. Moreover, a slight anisotropy at
zero collision energy was observed which is caused by the flattened velocity
distribution of the electron beam.
