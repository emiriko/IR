A general model for the early recognition and colocalization of homologous
DNA sequences is proposed. We show, on a thermodynamic ground, how the distance
between two homologous DNA sequences is spontaneously regulated by the
concentration and affinity of diffusible mediators binding them, which act as a
switch between two phases corresponding to independence or colocalization of
pairing regions.
