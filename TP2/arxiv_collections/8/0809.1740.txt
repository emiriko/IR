In the usual rod and slot paradox, the rod, if it falls, was expected to fall
into the slot due to gravity. Many thought experiments have been conducted
where the presence of gravity is eliminated with the rod and slot approaching
each other along a line joining their centers, whereby the considerations come
strictly under Special Relativity. In these experiments the line of motion is
not parallel to either the axis of the rod or the slot. In this paper we
consider in detail the two cases when the rod does fall into the slot and when
the rod does not fall into the slot, each from the perspective of the co-moving
frames of the rod and the slot. We show that whether the rod falls into the
slot as determined by Galilean kinematics is also valid under relativistic
kinematics; this determination does not depend upon the magnitude of the
velocity, but only on the proper lengths and the proper angles of the rod and
slot with the line of motion. Our conclusion emphasizes the fact that the
passing (or crashing) of the rod as a wholesome event is unaffected by
relativistic kinematics. We also provide a simple formula to determine whether
or not the rod passes through the slot.
