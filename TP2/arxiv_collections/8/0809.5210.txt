Angular correlations of high-pT hadrons can serve as a probe of interactions
of partons with the dense medium produced in high-energy heavy-ion collisions
but other sources of such correlations exist which can be non-negligible SPS
energies. In an attempt to determine the primary source, NA49 has performed an
energy and system-size scan of two-particle azimuthal correlations in central
Pb+Pb, Si+Si and p+p collisions at 158A GeV, as well as central Pb+Pb
collisions at 20A, 30A, 40A and 80A GeV. Moreover, results at 158A GeV have
been compared to UrQMD simulations.
