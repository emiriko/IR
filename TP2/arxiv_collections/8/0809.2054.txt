The systematic pressure shifts of T_c were investigated in the whole phase
diagram of the FeAs-based superconducting compound K_xSr_{1-x}Fe_2As_2.
Different regions, arising from corresponding responses of T$_c$ to pressure
(dT_c/dp>0, =0, or <0), can be clearly distinguished. This reveals an
interesting similarity of the FeAs superconductors and the high-T_c cuprates.
This behavior is a manifestation of the layered structure of the FeAs compounds
and the pressure-induced charge transfer between the (Fe_2As_2) and (K/Sr)
layers. The coexistence of superconductivity and spin-density wave behavior
were also observed, and the pressure effects on the latter is explored.
