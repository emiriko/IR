We point out possible features of neutrino spectra from a future galactic
core collapse supernova that will enhance our understanding of neutrino mixing
as well as supernova astrophysics. We describe the neutrino flavor conversions
inside the star, emphasizing the role of "collective effects" that has been
appreciated and understood only very recently. These collective effects change
the traditional predictions of flavor conversion substantially, and enable the
identification of neutrino mixing scenarios through signatures like Earth
matter effects.
