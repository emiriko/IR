Hawking radiation is obtained from the Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m blackhole with
a global monopole and the Garfinkle-Horowitz-Strominger blackhole falling in
the class of the most general spherically symmetric blackholes
$(\sqrt{-g}\neq1)$, using only chiral anomaly near the event horizon and
covariant boundary condition at the event horizon. The approach differs from
the anomaly cancellation approach since apart from the covariant boundary
condition, the chiral anomaly near the horizon is the only input to derive the
Hawking flux.
