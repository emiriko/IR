We report on a study of exotic nuclei around doubly magic 132Sn in terms of
the shell model employing a realistic effective interaction derived from the
CD-Bonn nucleon-nucleon potential. The short-range repulsion of the latter is
renormalized by constructing a smooth low-momentum potential, V-low-k, that is
used directly as input for the calculation of the effective interaction. In
this paper, we focus attention on proton-neutron multiplets in the odd-odd
nuclei 134Sb, 136Sb. We show that the behavior of these multiplets is quite
similar to that of the analogous multiplets in the counterpart nuclei in the
208Pb region, 210Bi and 212Bi.
