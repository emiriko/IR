We prove that the vector bundles at the core of the Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov
and quantum constructions of braid groups representations are topologically
trivial bundles. We provide partial generalizations of this result to
generalized braid groups. A crucial intermediate result is that the
representation ring of the symmetric group on n letters is generated by the
alternating powers of its natural n-dimensional representation.
