We report the observation of two resonance-like structures in the $\pi^+
\chi_{c1}$ invariant mass distribution near 4.1 GeV in exclusive $B\to
K\pi^+\chi_{c1}$ decays. A detailed Dalitz-plot analysis demonstrates that
these structures cannot be produced by reflections from any known and possibly
unknown resonances in the $K\pi$ channel. If these two peaks are produced by
resonances in the $\pi^+\chi_{c1}$ channel, their minimal quark structure would
have to be a $c\bar{c}u\bar{d}$ tetraquark arrangement, similar to that
proposed for the $Z^+(4430)$ structure reported by Belle last year in the
$\pi^+\psi^{'}$ mass distribution produced in $B\to K\pi^+\psi^{'}$ decays. In
addition, we report some new measurements on the properties of the X(3872)
meson and the $1^{--}$ $Y$ states that are produced with initial state
radiation. %and also other latest XYZ results. The analyses are based on a
large data sample recorded at the $\Upsilon(4S)$ resonances and nearby
continuum with the Belle detector at the KEKB asymmetric-energy $e^+e^-$
collider.
