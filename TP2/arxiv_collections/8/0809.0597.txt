In this note, we propose a simple derivation of the one dimensional hard rod
equation of state, with and without a Kac tail (appended long range and weak
potential). The case of hard spheres in higher dimension is also addressed and
it is shown there that our arguments --which avoid any mathematical
complication-- allow to recover the virial form of the equation of state in a
direct way.
