The initial conditions in the chemical non-equilibrated medium and Bjorken
expanding medium at RHIC are determined. With a set of rate equations
describing the chemical equilibration of quarks and gluons based on
perturbative QCD, we investigate the consequence for parton evolution at RHIC.
With considering parton evolution, it is shown that the Debye screening mass
and the inverse mean free-path of gluons reduce with increasing proper time in
the QGP medium. The parton evolution affects the parton energy loss with
detailed balance, both parton energy loss from stimulated emission in the
chemical non-equilibrated expanding medium and in Bjorken expanding medium are
linear dependent on the propagating distance rather than square dependent in
the static medium. The energy absorption can not be neglected at intermediate
jet energies and small propagating distance of the energetic parton in contrast
with that it is important only at intermediate jet energy in the static medium.
This will increase the energy and propagating distance dependence of the parton
energy loss and will affect the shape of suppression of moderately high P_T
hadron spectra.
