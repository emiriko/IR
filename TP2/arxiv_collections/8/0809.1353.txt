In this paper, we are concerned with the problem of existence of solutions
for generalized reflected backward stochastic differential equations (GRBSDEs
for short) and generalized backward stochastic differential equations (GBSDEs
for short) when the generator $fds + gdA_s$ is continuous with general growth
with respect to the variable $y$ and stochastic quadratic growth with respect
to the variable $z$. We deal with the case of a bounded terminal condition
$\xi$ and a bounded barrier $L$ as well as the case of unbounded ones. This is
done by using the notion of generalized BSDEs with two reflecting barriers
studied in \cite{EH}. The work is suggested by the interest the results might
have in finance, control and game theory.
