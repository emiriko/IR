In this work a tachyonization of the $\Lambda$CDM model for a spatially flat
Friedmann-Robertson-Walker space-time is proposed. A tachyon field and a
cosmological constant are considered as the sources of the gravitational field.
Starting from a stability analysis and from the exact solutions for a standard
tachyon field driven by a given potential, the search for a large set of
cosmological models which contain the $\Lambda$CDM model is investigated. By
the use of internal transformations two new kinds of tachyon fields are derived
from the standard tachyon field, namely, a complementary and a phantom tachyon
fields. Numerical solutions for the three kinds of tachyon fields are
determined and it is shown that the standard and complementary tachyon fields
reproduces the $\Lambda$CDM model as a limiting case. The standard tachyon
field can also describe a transition from an accelerated to a decelerated
regime, behaving as an inflaton field at early times and as a matter field at
late times. The complementary tachyon field always behaves as a matter field.
The phantom tachyon field is characterized by a rapid expansion where its
energy density increases with time.
