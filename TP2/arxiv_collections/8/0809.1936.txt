Recently, detailed calculations of the excitonic insulator phase model
adapted to the case of 1\textit{T}-TiSe$_2$ have been presented. Through the
spectral function theoretical photoemission intensity maps can be generated
which are in very good agreement with experiment [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 99},
(2007) 146403]. In this model, excitons condensate in a BCS-like manner and
give rise to a charge density wave, characterized by an order parameter. Here,
we assume an analytical form of the order parameter, allowing to perform
temperature dependent calculations. The influence of this order parameter on
the electronic spectral function, to be observed in photoemission spectra, is
discussed. The resulting chemical potential shift and an estimation of the
resistivity are also shown.
