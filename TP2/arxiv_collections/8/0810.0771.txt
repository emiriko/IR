In this thesis we analyze a very simple model of two dimensional quantum
gravity based on causal dynamical triangulations (CDT). We present an exactly
solvable model which indicates that it is possible to incorporate spatial
topology changes in the nonperturbative path integral. It is shown that if the
change in spatial topology is accompanied by a coupling constant it is possible
to evaluate the path integral to all orders in the coupling and that the result
can be viewed as a hybrid between causal and Euclidian dynamical triangulation.
The second model we describe shows how a classical geometry with constant
negative curvature emerges naturally from a path integral over noncompact
manifolds. No initial singularity is present, hence the quantum geometry is
naturally compatible with the Hartle Hawking boundary condition. Furthermore,
we demonstrate that under certain conditions the quantum fluctuations are
small! To conclude, we treat the problem of spacetime topology change. Although
we are not able to completely solve the path integral over all manifolds with
arbitrary topology, we do obtain results that indicate that such a path
integral might be consistent, provided suitable causality restrictions are
imposed.
