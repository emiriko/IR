In nearly all experiments with ultracold atoms time-of-flight pictures are
the only data available. In this paper we present an analytical strong-coupling
calculation for those time-of-flight pictures of bosons in an optical lattice
in the Mott phase. This allows us to determine the visibility, which quantifies
the contrast of peaks in the time-of-flight pictures, and we suggest how to use
it as a thermometer.
