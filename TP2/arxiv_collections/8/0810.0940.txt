We construct a natural measure mu supported on the intersection of a chordal
SLE(kappa) curve gamma with the real line R, in the range 4 < kappa < 8. The
measure is a function of the SLE path in question. Assuming that boundary
measures transform in a ``d-dimensional'' way (where d is the Hausdorff
dimension of gamma intersected with R), we show that the measure we construct
is (up to multiplicative constant) the unique measure-valued function of the
SLE path that satisfies the Domain Markov property.
