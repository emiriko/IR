We investigate the effect of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions on the low
temperature magnetic susceptibility for a system whose low energy physics is
dominated by short-range valence bonds (singlets). Our general perturbative
approach is applied to specific models expected to be in this class, including
the Shastry-Sutherland model of the spin-dimer compound SrCu_2(BO_3)_2 and the
antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model of the recently discovered S=1/2 kagome
compound ZnCu_3(OH)_6Cl_2. The central result is that a short-ranged valence
bond phase, when perturbed with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions, will remain
time-reversal symmetric in the absence of a magnetic field but the
susceptibility will be nonzero in the T\to 0 limit. Applied to
ZnCu_3(OH)_6Cl_2, this model provides an avenue for reconciling experimental
results, such as the lack of magnetic order and lack of any sign of a spin gap,
with known theoretical facts about the kagome Heisenberg antiferromagnet.
