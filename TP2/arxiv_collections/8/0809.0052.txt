We review the role of Drinfeld doubles and kappa-Poincare symmetries in
quantised (2+1)-gravity and Chern-Simons theory. We discuss the conditions
under which a given Hopf algebra symmetry is compatible with a Chern-Simons
theory and determine this compatibility explicitly for the Drinfeld doubles and
kappa-Poincare symmetries associated with the isometry groups of (2+1)-gravity.
In particular, we explain that the usual kappa-Poincare symmetries with a
timelike deformation are not directly associated with (2+1)-gravity. These
kappa-Poincare symmetries are linked to Chern-Simons theory only in the de
Sitter case, and the relevant Chern-Simons theory is physically inequivalent to
(2+1)-gravity.
