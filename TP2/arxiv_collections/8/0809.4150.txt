Heavy flavour production and spectroscopy are key components of the HERA
physics programme. I will summarise a selection of the recent results obtained
by the H1 and ZEUS collaborations. The production of excited charm mesons and
J/psi will be discussed as well as measurements of b quark cross-sections in
photoproduction. The status of searches for exotic bound states and the D*p
resonance will be updated.
