We consider i.i.d. random variables {\omega (b):b \in E_d} parameterized by
the family of bonds in Z^d, d>1. The random variable \omega(b) is thought of as
the conductance of bond b and it ranges in a finite interval [0,c_0]. Assuming
the probability m of the event {\omega(b)>0} to be supercritical and denoting
by C(\omega) the unique infinite cluster associated to the bonds with positive
conductance, we study the zero range process on C(\omega) with
\omega(b)-proportional probability rate of jumps along bond b. For almost all
realizations of the environment we prove that the hydrodynamic behavior of the
zero range process is governed by the nonlinear heat equation $\partial_t \rho=
m \nabla \cdot (D \nabla\phi(\rho/m))$, where the matrix D and the function
\phi are \omega--independent. We do not require any ellipticity condition.
