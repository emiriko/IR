The production of neutral strange hadrons is investigated using
deep-inelastic scattering events measured with the H1 detector at HERA. The
measurements are made in the phase space defined by the negative four-momentum
transfer squared of the photon 2 < Q^2 < 100 GeV^2 and the inelasticity 0.1 < y
< 0.6. The K_s and Lambda production cross sections and their ratios are
determined. K_s production is compared to the production of charged particles
in the same region of phase space. The Lambda - anti-Lambda asymmetry is also
measured and found to be consistent with zero. Predictions of leading order
Monte Carlo programs are compared to the data.
