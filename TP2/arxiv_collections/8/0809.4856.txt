We consider Markovian models on graphs with local dynamics. We show that,
under suitable conditions, such Markov chains exhibit both rapid convergence to
equilibrium and strong concentration of measure in the stationary distribution.
We illustrate our results with applications to some known chains from computer
science and statistical mechanics.
