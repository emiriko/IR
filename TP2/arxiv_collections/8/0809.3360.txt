Despite the advances in the development of numerical methods analytical
approaches play a key role on the way towards a deeper understanding of
strongly interacting systems. In this regards, renormalization schemes for
Hamiltonians represent an important new direction in the field. Among these
renormalization schemes the projector-based renormalization method (PRM)
reviewed here might be the approach with the widest range of possible
applications: As demonstrated in this review, continuous unitary
transformations, perturbation theory, non-perturbative phenomena, and
quantum-phase transitions can be understood within the same theoretical
framework. This review starts from the definition of an effective Hamiltonian
by means of projection operators that allows the evaluation within perturbation
theory as well as the formulation of a renormalization scheme. The developed
approach is then applied to three different many-particle systems: At first, we
study the electron-phonon problem to discuss several modifications of the
method and to demonstrate how phase transitions can be described within the
PRM. Secondly, to show that non-perturbative phenomena are accessible by the
PRM, the periodic Anderson model is investigated to describe heavy-fermion
behavior. Finally, we discuss the quantum-phase transition in the
one-dimensional Holstein model of spinless fermions where both metallic and
insulating phase are described within the same theoretical framework.
