We experimentally realize a high-intensity three-photon
Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) entanglement source directly following the
proposal by Rarity and Tapster [J. G. Rarity and P. R. Tapster, Phys. Rev. A
59, R35 (1999)]. The threefold coincidence rate can be more than 200 Hz with a
fidelity of 0.811, and the intensity can be further improved with moderate
fidelity degradation. The GHZ entanglement is characterized by testing the
Bell-Mermin inequality and using an entanglement witness operator. To optimize
the polarization-entangled source, we theoretically analyze the relationship
between the mean photon number of the single-photon source and the probability
of parametric down-conversion.
