Flows of dense emulsions show many complex features among which long range
nonlocal effects pose a problem for macroscopic characterization. In order to
get around this problem, we study the flows of several dense emulsions in a
wide-gap Couette geometry. We couple macroscopic rheometric experiments and
local velocity measurements through MRI techniques. As concentration
heterogeneities can be expected, we designed a method to measure the local
droplet concentration in emulsions with a MRI device. In contrast to dense
suspensions of rigid particles where very fast migration occurs under shear, we
show that no migration takes place in dense emulsions even for strains as large
as 100 000 in our systems. As a result of the absence of migration and of
finite size effect, we are able to determine very precisely the local
rheological behavior of several dense emulsions. As the materials are
homogeneous, this behavior can also be inferred from purely macroscopic
measurements. We thus suggest that properly analyzed purely macroscopic
measurements in a wide-gap Couette geometry can be used as a tool to study the
local constitutive laws of dense emulsions. All behaviors are basically
consistent with Herschel-Bulkley laws of index 0.5, but discrepancies exist at
the approach of the yield stress due to slow shear flows below the apparent
yield stress in the case of a strongly adhesive emulsion. The existence of a
constitutive law accounting for all flows contrasts with previous results
obtained within a microchannel by Goyon et al. (2008): the use of a wide-gap
Couette geometry is likely to prevent here from nonlocal finite size effects;
it also contrasts with the observations of B\'ecu et al. (2006).
