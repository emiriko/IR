We study the pion spectrum (and in particular taste-symmetry breaking within
it) using HYP-smeared valence staggered fermions on the coarse and fine MILC
lattices (which have asqtad staggered sea quarks). We focus on the dependence
on lattice spacing and sea-quark mass. We also update our results on source
dependence. Our main conclusion is that on the MILC fine lattices the
appropriate power-counting for SU(3) staggered chiral perturbation theory may
have discretization errors entering at next-to-leading order rather than at
leading-order.
