We present model wavefunctions for quasielectron (as opposed to quasihole)
excitations of the unitary $Z_k$ parafermion sequence
(Laughlin/Moore-Read/Read-Rezayi) of Fractional Quantum Hall states. We
uniquely define these states through two generalized clustering conditions:
they vanish when either a cluster of $k+2$ electrons is put together, or when
two clusters of $k+1$ electrons are formed at different positions. For Abelian
Fractional Quantum Hall states ($k=1$), our construction reproduces the Jain
quasielectron wavefunction, and elucidates the difference between the Jain and
Laughlin quasielectrons. For two (or more) quasielectrons, our states differ
from those constructed using Jain's method. By adding our quasielectrons to the
Laughlin state, we obtain a hierarchy scheme which gives rise the non-Abelian
non-unitary $\nu={2/5}$ FQH Gaffnian state.
