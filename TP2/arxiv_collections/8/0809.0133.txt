We introduce a concept of noncoherent optical pulse discrimination from a
coherent (or partially coherent) signal of the same energy using a phenomenon
of soliton generation. The impact of randomisation of the optical signal
content on the observable characteristics of solitons generation is examined
and quantified for a particular example of rectangular pulse.
