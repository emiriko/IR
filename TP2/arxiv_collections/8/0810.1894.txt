Galilei-invariant equations for massless fields are obtained via contractions
of relativistic wave equations. It is shown that the collection of
non-equivalent Galilei-invariant wave equations for massless fields with spin
equal 1 and 0 is very reach and corresponds to various contractions of the
representations of the Lorentz group to those of the Galilei one. It describes
many physically consistent systems, e.g., those of electromagnetic fields in
various media or Galilean Chern-Simon models. Finally, classification of all
linear and a big group of non-linear Galilei-invariant equations for massless
fields is presented.
