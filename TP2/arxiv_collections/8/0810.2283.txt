Gamow solutions are used to transform self-adjoint energy operators by means
of factorization (supersymmetric) techniques. The transformed non-hermitian
operators admit a discrete real spectrum which is occasionally extended by a
single complex eigenvalue associated to normalized eigensolutions. These new
Hamiltonians are not pseudo-hermitian operators and also differ from those
obtained by means of complex-scaling transformations. As an example,
Coulomb-like potentials are studied.
