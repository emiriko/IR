This thesis presents two descriptions of complexity in dynamical systems. The
algebraic approach deals with the differential Galois group theory and its
restrictions on integrability. The geometric part is a formulation of dynamics
in the language of differential geometry with particular application to
Lyapunov exponents and variational equations. The algorithm for calculating the
Lyapunov spectrum is illustrated with three examples.
