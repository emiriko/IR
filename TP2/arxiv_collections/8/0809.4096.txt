Metal mixed polymers are a cheap and effective way to produce flexible metals
and superconductors. As part of an on-going effort to learn how to tune the
properties of these systems with ion implantation, we present a study of the
electrical properties of these systems prior to metal-mixing. We show that the
electrical properties of tin-antimony thin films are remarkably robust to
variations in the substrate morphology. We demonstrate that the optical
absorbance of the films at a fixed wavelength provides a reliable and
reproducible characterization of the relative film thickness. We find that as
the film thickness is reduced, the superconducting transition in the
unimplanted thin films is broadened, but the onset of the transition remains at
~3.7 K, the transition temperature of bulk Sn. This is in marked contrast to
the behavior of metal mixed films, which suggests that the metal mixing process
has a significant effect of the physics of the superconducting state beyond
that achieved by reducing the film thickness alone.
