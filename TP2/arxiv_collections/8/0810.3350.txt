We present recent results on top quark pair production cross section and
forward-backward asymmetry at the Tevatron. Three new cross section
measurements from CDF and one new measurement from DO are presented that
utilize the full dataset available. A new DO top cross section combination
gives a ttbar production cross section of sigma_ttbar = 7.83 + 0.46-0.45 (stat)
+ 0.64-0.53 (syst) +-0.48 (lumi). The new CDF cross section combination for
ttbar production is found to be 7.0 +- 0.3 (stat) +- 0.4 (syst) +- 0.4 (lumi)
pb giving a total uncertainty of 9%, very close to the that of the current best
theoretical predictions. It is important to measure the top cross section in as
many different channels as possible and investigate their compatibility. This
is useful as new physics might show up differently in the different channels.
Thus any significant discrepancy could be a sign of new physics. Three new
measurements of the forward-backward asymmetry are also presented. The two CDF
measurements unfold the observed asymmetry back to parton level in order to
directly compare the values obtained with theoretical predictions. The DO
measurement is not unfolded and therefore does not depend on the specific
method used for unfolding.
