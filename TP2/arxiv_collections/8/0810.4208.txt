We analyze the AC Stark shift of the Cs microwave atomic clock transition
theoretically and experimentally. Theoretical and experimental data are in a
good agreement with each other. Results indicate the absence of a magic
wavelength at which there would be no differential shift of the clock states
having zero projections of the total angular momentum.
