In this work we present the theoretical framework for the solution of the
time-dependent Schr\"{o}dinger equation (TDSE) of atomic and molecular systems
under strong electromagnetic fields with the configuration space of the
electron's coordinates separated over two regions, that is regions $I$ and
$II$. In region $I$ the solution of the TDSE is obtained by an R-matrix basis
set representation of the time-dependent wavefunction. In region $II$ a grid
representation of the wavefunction is considered and propagation in space and
time is obtained through the finite-differences method. It appears this is the
first time a combination of basis set and grid methods has been put forward for
tackling multi-region time-dependent problems. In both regions, a high-order
explicit scheme is employed for the time propagation. While, in a purely
hydrogenic system no approximation is involved due to this separation, in
multi-electron systems the validity and the usefulness of the present method
relies on the basic assumption of R-matrix theory, namely that beyond a certain
distance (encompassing region $I$) a single ejected electron is distinguishable
from the other electrons of the multi-electron system and evolves there (region
II) effectively as a one-electron system. The method is developed in detail for
single active electron systems and applied to the exemplar case of the hydrogen
atom in an intense laser field.
