Non-universal boundary conditions in grand unified theories can lead to
non-universal gaugino masses at the unification scale. In R-parity preserving
theories the lightest supersymmetric particle is a natural candidate for the
dark matter. In this talk the composition of the lightest neutralino is
studied, when nonuniversal gaugino masses come from representations of SO(10).
In these cases, the thermal relic density compatible with WMAP observations is
found.
