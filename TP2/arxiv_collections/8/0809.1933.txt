We clarify the purely imaginary quasinormal frequencies of a massless scalar
perturbation on the 3D charged-dilaton black holes. This case is quite
interesting because the potential-step appears outside the event horizon
similar to the case of the electromagnetic perturbations on the large
Schwarzschild-AdS black holes. It turns out that the potential-step type
provides the purely imaginary quasinormal frequencies, while the
potential-barrier type gives the complex quasinormal modes.
