We generalize the classical Satake equivalence as follows. Let k be an
algebraically closed field, set O=k[[t]] and F=k((t)). For an almost simple
algebraic group G we classify central extensions of G(F) by the multiplicative
group. Any such extension E splits canonically over G(O). Consider the category
of G(O)-biinvariant perverse sheaves on E with a given Gm-monodromy . We show
that this is a tensor category, which is tensor equivalent to the category of
representations of a reductive group. We compute the root datum of this group.
