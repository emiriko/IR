Laser cooling and trapping are now widely used in atomic physics laboratory.
Interestingly, cold atoms in optical lattices are now used in advanced research
to mimic phenomena in condensed matter physics and also as a test laboratory
for the models of these phenomena. It follows then that it is now possible and
necessary to advance the atomic physics laboratory by including the use of
ultracold atoms in optical lattices for instructional contents of phenomena in
condensed matter physics. In this paper, we have proposed how to introduce into
the atomic physics laboratory the study of quantum magnetism with cold atoms in
a double well optical lattice. In particular, we demonstrates how to compare
the theoretical parameters of a spin Hamiltonian model with those extracted
from spin ordering experiment.
