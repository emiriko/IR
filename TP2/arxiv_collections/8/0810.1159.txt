We employ the point canonical transformation (PCT) to solve the D-dimensional
Schr\"{o}dinger equation with position-dependent effective mass (PDEM) function
for two molecular pseudoharmonic and modified Kratzer (Mie-type) potentials. In
mapping the transformed exactly solvable D-dimensional ($D\geq 2$)
Schr\"{o}dinger equation with constant mass into the effective mass equation by
employing a proper transformation, the exact bound state solutions including
the energy eigenvalues and corresponding wave functions are derived. The
well-known pseudoharmonic and modified Kratzer exact eigenstates of various
dimensionality is manifested.
