Hard x-ray photoemission and optical spectroscopies have been performed on
YbS and Yb metal to determine the precise $f$-electron occupation. A comparison
of the photoemission spectra with the energy loss functions in bulk and
surface, obtained from optical reflectivity, enables us to distinguish between
the energy loss satellite of Yb$^{2+}$ peak and Yb$^{3+}$ multiplet. The
results clearly indicate a purely divalent Yb state except for the surface of
YbS. We demonstrate that the present method is highly reliable in identifying
the electronic structure and the mean valence in $f$-electron systems.
