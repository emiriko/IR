Clustering and community structure is crucial for many network systems and
the related dynamic processes. It has been shown that communities are usually
overlapping and hierarchical. However, previous methods investigate these two
properties of community structure separately. This paper proposes an algorithm
(EAGLE) to detect both the overlapping and hierarchical properties of complex
community structure together. This algorithm deals with the set of maximal
cliques and adopts an agglomerative framework. The quality function of
modularity is extended to evaluate the goodness of a cover. The examples of
application to real world networks give excellent results.
