This article deals with a number of topics which are, somewhat surprisingly,
related. Firstly, the fundamental theorem of skew invariant theory for the
symplectic group giving the generators and relations of symplectic invariants
is established. The relations are the so called P_n relations which appear in
the study of certain 3-manifold invariants. Next a class of cohomology groups
are introduced, called Pluri-Hodge groups (somewhat in keeping with the notion
of pluri-canonical groups). These are Dolbeault groups on a complex manifold X
with values in tensor powers of sheaves of holomorphic forms of various
degrees. By Riemann-Roch one shows that knowledge of the Pluri-Hodge groups
gives precise formulae for all Chern numbers of the manifold. When X is
holomorphic symplectic the Pluri-Hodge groups form representations of Sp(g)
where g counts the number of tensor products. Still with X holomorphic
symplectic, the Pluri-Hodge groups are vectors in the vector space H_g(X) of
states in the topological field theory of Rozansky and Witten for a 3-manifold
with boundary a Riemann surface of genus g. A formulation of the
Murakami-Ohtsuki invariants, due to Sawon, allows us to show that quotients of
the spaces of trivalent graphs B_g carry representations of the symplectic
group. There is a weight system W_X: B_g -> H_g(X) and we show that W_X
preserves the various symplectic group actions.
