We describe a setup which will allow extend the physics reach of the STAR
detector at RHIC to include the measurement of very forward protons. Tagging on
very forward protons, detected by the Roman Pots at RHIC energies, selects
processes, in which the proton stays intact and the exchange is dominated by
one with the quantum numbers of the vacuum, thus enhancing the probability of
measuring reactions where colorless gluonic matter dominates the exchange. The
processes include both elastic and inelastic diffraction. The capabilities of
the STAR detector to detect Gleuballs and Exotics in central production
mechanism are described.
