The minimization of Gibbs free energy is based on the changes in work and
free energy that occur in a physical or chemical system. The maximization of
mutual information, the capacity, of a noisy channel is determined based on the
marginal probabilities and conditional entropies associated with a
communications system. As different as the procedures might first appear,
through the exploration of a simple, "dual use" Ising model, it is seen that
the two concepts are in fact the same. In particular, the case of a binary
symmetric channel is calculated in detail.
