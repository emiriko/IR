We analyze bound states of an electron in the field of a positively charged
nanoshell. We find that the binding and excitation energies of the system
decrease when the radius of the nanoshell increases. We also show that the
ground and the first excited states of this system have remarkably the same
properties of the highly excited Rydberg states of a hydrogen-like atom i.e. a
high sensitivity to the external perturbations and long radiative lifetimes.
