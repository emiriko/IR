Full jet reconstruction in relativistic heavy ion collisions provides new and
unique insights to the physics of parton energy loss. Because of the large
underlying event multiplicity in $A+A$ collisions, random and correlated
fluctuations in the background can result in the reconstruction of fake jets.
These fake jets must be identified and rejected to obtain the purest jet sample
possible. A large but reducible fake rate of jets reconstructed using an
iterative cone algorithm on HIJING events is observed. The absolute rate of
fake jets exceeds the binary-scaled p+p jet rate below 50 GeV and is not
negligible until 100 GeV. The variable $\Sigma j_{T}$, the sum of the jet
constituent's $E_{T}$ perpendicular to the jet axis, is introduced to identify
and reject fake jets at by a factor of 100 making it negligible. This variable
is shown to not strongly depend on jet energy profiles modified by energy loss.
By studying azimuthal correlations of reconstructed di-jets, the fake jet rate
can be evaluated in data.
