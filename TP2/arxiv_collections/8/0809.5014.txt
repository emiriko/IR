I consider the prospect to use the outer layer of the Moon as a detector
volume for ultra-high energy (UHE) neutrino fluxes and the flux of the lightest
neutralino which I assume is the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP). For
this purpose, I calculate the event rates of these fluxes for top-down
scenarios. I show that a suitable experiment for the detection of radio waves
might be able to detect sufficient event rates after a measurement period of
one year.
