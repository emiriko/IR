We extend the early time ordering theory of Cahn, Hilliard, and Cook
  (CHC) so that our generalized theory applies to solid-to-solid transitions.
Our theory involves spatial symmetry breaking (the initial phase contains a
symmetry not present in the final phase). The predictions of our generalization
differ from those of the CHC theory in two important ways: exponential growth
does not begin immediately following the quench, and the objects that grow
exponentially are not necessarily Fourier modes. Our theory is consistent with
simulation results for the long-range antiferromagnetic Ising model.
