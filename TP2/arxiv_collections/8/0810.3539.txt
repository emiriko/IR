In this letter, we present the first experimental study of a new chiral
metamaterial consisting of toroidal wire windings. We show that the
metamaterial exhibits three bands of circular dichroism in the GHz range. We
discuss the response of the structure in terms of multipole moments, including
the (magnetic) toroidal dipole moment.
