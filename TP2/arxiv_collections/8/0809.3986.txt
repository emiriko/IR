Current long baseline experiments aim at measuring neutrino oscillation
parameters with a high precision. A critical quantity is the neutrino energy
which can not be measured directly but has to be reconstructed from the
observed hadrons. A good knowledge of neutrino-nucleus interactions is thus
necessary to minimize the systematic uncertainties in neutrino fluxes,
backgrounds and detector responses. In particular final-state interactions
inside the target nucleus modify considerably the particle yields through
rescattering, charge-exchange and absorption. Nuclear effects can be described
with our coupled channel GiBUU transport model where the neutrino first
interacts with a bound nucleon producing secondary particles which are then
transported out of the nucleus. In this contribution, we give some examples for
the application of our model focusing in particular on the MiniBooNE and K2K
experiments.
