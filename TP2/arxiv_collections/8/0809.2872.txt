We consider a family of vector fields defined in some bounded domain of R^p,
and we assume that they satisfy Hormander's rank condition of some step r, and
that their coefficients have r-1 continuous derivatives. We extend to this
nonsmooth context some results which are well-known for smooth Hormander's
vector fields, namely: some basic properties of the distance induced by the
vector fields, the doubling condition, Chow's connectivity theorem, and, under
the stronger assumption that the coefficients belong to C^{r-1,1}, Poincare's
inequality. By known results, these facts also imply a Sobolev embedding. All
these tools allow to draw some consequences about second order differential
operators modeled on these nonsmooth Hormander's vector fields.
