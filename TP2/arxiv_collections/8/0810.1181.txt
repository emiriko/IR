In this research, the totally asymmetric exclusion process without particle
number conservation is discussed. Based on the mean field approximation and the
Rankine-Hugoniot condition, the necessary and sufficient conditions of the
existence of the domain wall have been obtained. Moreover, the properties of
the domain wall, including the location and height, have been studied
theoretically. All the theoretical results are demonstrated by the computer
simulations.
