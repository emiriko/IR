This work presents the relations between the carbon to carbon bond lengths in
the single, double and triple bonds and in graphite, butadiene and benzene. The
Golden ratio, which was shown to divide the Bohr radius into two parts
pertaining to the charged particles, the electron and proton, and to divide
inter-atomic distances into their cationic and anionic radii, also plays a role
in the carbon-carbon bonds and in the ionic/polar character of those in
graphite, butadiene and benzene. Further, the bond energies of the various CC
bonds are shown to vary linearly with the bond lengths.
