The first main purpose of this paper is to contribute to the existing
knowledge about the complex projective surfaces $S$ of general type with
$p_g(S) = 0$ and their moduli spaces, constructing 19 new families of such
surfaces with hitherto unknown fundamental groups. We also provide a table
containing all the known such surfaces with K^2 <=7.
  Our second main purpose is to describe in greater generality the fundamental
groups of smooth projective varieties which occur as the minimal resolutions of
the quotient of a product of curves by the action of a finite group.
  We classify, in the two dimensional case, all the surfaces with q=p_g = 0
obtained as the minimal resolution of such a quotient, having rational double
points as singularities. We show that all these surfaces give evidence to the
Bloch conjecture.
