This paper attempt has been made to explain a fuzzy commitment scheme. In the
conventional Commitment schemes, both committed string m and valid opening key
are required to enable the sender to prove the commitment. However there could
be many instances where the transmission involves noise or minor errors arising
purely because of the factors over which neither the sender nor the receiver
have any control. The fuzzy commitment scheme presented in this paper is to
accept the opening key that is close to the original one in suitable distance
metric, but not necessarily identical. The concept itself is illustrated with
the help of simple situation.
