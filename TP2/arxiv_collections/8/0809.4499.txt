This work is based on the field of reference frames based on quantum
representations of real and complex numbers described in other work. Here frame
domains are expanded to include space and time lattices. Strings of qukits are
described as hybrid systems as they are both mathematical and physical systems.
As mathematical systems they represent numbers. As physical systems in each
frame the strings have a discrete Schrodinger dynamics on the lattices. The
frame field has an iterative structure such that the contents of a stage j
frame have images in a stage j-1 (parent) frame. A discussion of parent frame
images includes the proposal that points of stage j frame lattices have images
as hybrid systems in parent frames. The resulting association of energy with
images of lattice point locations, as hybrid systems states, is discussed.
Representations and images of other physical systems in the different frames
are also described.
