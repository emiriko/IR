We describe a novel effect involving odd-order dispersion cancellation. We
demonstrate that odd- and even-order dispersion cancellation may be obtained in
different regions of a single quantum interferogram using
frequency-anticorrelated entangled photons and a new type of quantum
interferometer. This offers new opportunities for quantum communication and
metrology in dispersive media.
