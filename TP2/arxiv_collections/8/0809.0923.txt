Advances in quantum physics and computational complexity threaten the
security of present day cryptographic systems and have driven the development
of quantum key distribution (QKD). Entangled quantum key distribution (EQKD) is
a secure protocol that is based on fundamental quantum mechanics and is not
vulnerable to these threats. The primary figure of merit for QKD systems is
ability to generate secret bits. However, to date, methods that have been
developed to simulate the secret bit rate generation for EQKD systems have been
limited by techniques that do not provide a complete description of the quantum
state produced by the source. In this paper, we provide a complete description
and comparison of the secret bit rate for continuous-wave and pulsed laser EQKD
systems. In particular, we highlight the relevant Poissonian and thermal photon
statistics that affect the EQKD secret bit rate and use practical system
parameters and configurations to show regimes where one expects optimal
performance for each case.
