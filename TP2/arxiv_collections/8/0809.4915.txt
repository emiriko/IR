The Standard Model processes of W, Z and top quark production in association
with jets constitute a major background to searches for Supersymmetry at the
LHC. We describe recent work performed in the ATLAS Collaboration to estimate
these backgrounds for a basic SUSY selection, and we discuss methods to derive
them from the first ATLAS data.
