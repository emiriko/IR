We derive explicit Lorentz-invariant solution of the Einstein and null
geodesic equations for data processing of the time delay and ranging
experiments in gravitational field of moving gravitating bodies of the solar
system - the Sun and major planets. We discuss general-relativistic
interpretation of these experiments and the limitations imposed by motion of
the massive bodies on measurement of the parameters gamma_{PPN}, beta_{PPN} and
delta_{PPN} of the parameterized post-Newtonian formalism.
