The nonequilibrium time-dependent fluctuations of charge current have
recently emerged as a sensitive experimental tool to probe ballistic transport
through evanescent wave functions introduced into clean wide and short graphene
strips by the attached metallic electrodes. We demonstrate that such
"pseudo-diffusive" shot noise can be substantially modified in zigzag graphene
nanoribbon (ZGNR) due to the topology of its edges responsible for localized
states that facilitate ferromagnetic ordering along the edge when Coulomb
interaction is taken into account. Thus, the shot noise enhancement of
unpolarized, and even more sensitively of spin-polarized, charge currents
injected into ZGNR will act as an all-electrical and edge-sensitive probe of
such low-dimensional magnetism.
