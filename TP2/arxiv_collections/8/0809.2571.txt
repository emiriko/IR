We review the recent noticeable progresses in black hole physics focusing on
the up-coming super-collider, the LHC. We discuss the classical formation of
black holes by particle collision, the greybody factors for higher dimensional
rotating black holes, the deep implications of black hole physics to the
`energy-distance' relation, the security issues of the LHC associated with
black hole formation and the newly developed Monte-Carlo generators for black
hole events.
