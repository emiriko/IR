Side-channel attacks are efficient attacks against cryptographic devices.
They use only quantities observable from outside, such as the duration and the
power consumption. Attacks against synchronous devices using electric
observations are facilitated by the fact that all transitions occur
simultaneously with some global clock signal. Asynchronous control remove this
synchronization and therefore makes it more difficult for the attacker to
insulate \emph{interesting intervals}. In addition the coding of data in an
asynchronous circuit is inherently more difficult to attack. This article
describes the Programmable Logic Block of an asynchronous FPGA resistant
against \emph{side-channel attacks}. Additionally it can implement different
styles of asynchronous control and of data representation.
