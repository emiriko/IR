We find a specific mechanism of background spin currents in two-dimensional
electron systems with spatially nonuniform spin-orbit interaction (SOI) at
thermodynamic equilibrium, in particular, in the systems consisting of regions
with and without SOI. The spin density flows tangentially to the boundary in
the normal and SOI regions within a layer of the width determined by the SOI
strength. The density of these edge currents significantly exceeds the bulk
spin current density. The spin current is polarized normally to the boundary.
The spatial distribution of equilibrium spin currents is investigated in detail
in the case of a step-like variation of the SOI strength and potential at the
interface.
