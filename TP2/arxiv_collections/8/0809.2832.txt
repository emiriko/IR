The Fermi surface (FS) of ErTe3 is investigated using angle-resolved
photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). Low temperature measurements reveal two
incommensurate charge density wave (CDW) gaps created by perpendicular FS
nesting vectors. A large Delta_1 = 175 meV gap arising from a CDW with c* -
q_CDW1 ~ 0.70(0) c* is in good agreement with the expected value. A second,
smaller Delta_2 = 50 meV gap is due to a second CDW with a* - q_CDW2 ~ 0.68(5)
a*. The temperature dependence of the FS, the two gaps and possible interaction
between the CDWs are examined.
