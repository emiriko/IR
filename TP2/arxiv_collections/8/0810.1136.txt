Tannin-tannin and tannin-protein interactions in water-ethanol solvent
mixtures are studied in the context of red wine tasting. While tannin
self-aggregation is relevant for visual aspect of wine tasting (limpidity and
related colloidal phenomena), tannin affinities for salivary proline-rich
proteins is fundamental for a wide spectrum of organoleptic properties related
to astringency. Tannin-tannin interactions are analyzed in water-ethanol
wine-like solvents and the precipitation map is constructed for a typical grape
tannin. The interaction between tannins and human salivary proline-rich
proteins (PRP) are investigated in the framework of the shell model for
micellization, known for describing tannin-induced aggregation of beta-casein.
Tannin-assisted micellization and compaction of proteins observed by SAXS are
described quantitatively and discussed in the case of astringency.
