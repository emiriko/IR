We report on DNA arrays produced by Dip Pen Nanolithography (DPN) on a novel
Au-Ag micro patterned template stripped surface. DNA arrays have been
investigated by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning tunnelling
microscopy (STM) showing that the patterned template stripped substrate enables
easy retrieval of the DPN-functionalized zone with a standard optical
microscope permitting a multi-instrument and multi-technique local detection
and analysis. Moreover the smooth surface of the Au squares (abput 5-10
angstrom roughness) allows to be sensitive to the hybridization of the
oligonucleotide array with label-free target DNA. Our Au-Ag substrates,
combining the retrieving capabilities of the patterned surface with the
smoothness of the template stripped technique, are candidates for the
investigation of DPN nanostructures and for the development of label free
detection methods for DNA nanoarrays based on the use of scanning probes.
