Consider a multidimensional SDE of the form $X_t = x+\int_{0}^{t}
b(X_{s-})ds+\int{0}^{t} f(X_{s-})dZ_s$ where $(Z_s)_{s\ge 0}$ is a symmetric
stable process. Under suitable assumptions on the coefficients the unique
strong solution of the above equation admits a density w.r.t. the Lebesgue
measure and so does its Euler scheme. Using a parametrix approach, we derive an
error expansion at order 1 w.r.t. the time step for the difference of these
densities.
