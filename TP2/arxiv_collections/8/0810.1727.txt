We study one-flavor QCD at finite temperature and chemical potential using
the functional renormalization group. We discuss the chiral phase transition in
QCD and its order with its underlying mechanism in terms of quarks and gluons
and analyze the dependence of the phase transition temperature on small quark
chemical potentials. Our result for the curvature of the phase boundary at
small quark chemical potential relies on only a single input parameter, the
value of the strong coupling at the Z mass scale.
