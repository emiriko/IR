We report muon-spin relaxation measurements of highly homogeneous samples of
FeAs and FeAs2, both previously found as impurity phases in some samples of
recently synthesized pnictide superconductors. We observe well defined muon
precession in the FeAs sample with two precession frequencies of 38.2(3) and
22.7(9) MHz at 7.5 K, with the majority of the amplitude corresponding to the
lower frequency component. In FeAs2 we confirm previous measurements showing
that no long-ranged magnetic order occurs above 2 K and measure the muon spin
relaxation rate, which increases on cooling. Our results exclude the
possibility that previous muon-spin relaxation measurements of pnictide
superconductors have been measuring the effect of these possible impurities.
