We propose an entropic geometrical model of psycho-physical crowd dynamics
(with dissipative crowd kinematics), using Feynman action-amplitude formalism
that operates on three synergetic levels: macro, meso and micro. The intent is
to explain the dynamics of crowds simultaneously and consistently across these
three levels, in order to characterize their geometrical properties
particularly with respect to behavior regimes and the state changes between
them. Its most natural statistical descriptor is crowd entropy $S$ that
satisfies the Prigogine's extended second law of thermodynamics,
$\partial_tS\geq 0$ (for any nonisolated multi-component system). Qualitative
similarities and superpositions between individual and crowd configuration
manifolds motivate our claim that goal-directed crowd movement operates under
entropy conservation, $\partial_tS = 0$, while natural crowd dynamics operates
under (monotonically) increasing entropy function, $\partial_tS > 0$. Between
these two distinct topological phases lies a phase transition with a chaotic
inter-phase. Both inertial crowd dynamics and its dissipative kinematics
represent diffusion processes on the crowd manifold governed by the Ricci flow,
with the associated Perelman entropy-action.
