The Vud element of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa quark mixing matrix has
traditionally been determined from the analysis of data in nuclear superallowed
0+ to 0+ transitions, neutron decay and pion beta decay. We show here that this
element can independently be determined from nuclear mirror transitions. The
extracted value, |Vud| = 0.9719 +- 0.0017, is at 1.2 combined standard
deviations from the value obtained in superallowed 0+ to 0+ transitions and has
a similar precision than the value obtained from neutron decay experiments. We
discuss some prospects to improve its precision through experiments in nuclear
mirror transitions.
