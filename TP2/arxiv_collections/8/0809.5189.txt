In this paper, we propose a novel channel estimation technique based on
spread pilots for digital video broadcasting. This technique consists in adding
a linear preceding function before the OFDM modulation and dedicating one of
the preceding sequence to transmit the pilot symbols for the channel
estimation. The merits of this technique are its simplicity, its flexibility,
and the gains in terms of spectral efficiency and useful bit rate obtained
compared to the classical pilot based estimation schemes used in DVB standards.
The performance evaluated over realistic channel models, shows the efficiency
of this technique which turns out to be a promising channel estimation
technique for the future terrestrial video broadcasting systems.
