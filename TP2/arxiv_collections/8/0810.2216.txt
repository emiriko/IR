The role of thermal fluctuations on the conformational dynamics of a single
closed filament is studied. It is shown that, due to the interaction between
charges and bending degrees of freedom, initially circular aggregates may
undergo transformation to polygonal shape. The transition occurs both in the
case of hardening and softening charge-bending interaction. In the former case
the charge and curvature are smoothly distributed along the chain while in the
latter spontaneous kink formation is initiated. The transition to a
non-circular conformation is analogous to the phase transition of the second
kind.
