A confining gauge theory violates the completeness of asymptotic states held
as foundation points of the $S$-matrix. Spin-dependent experiments can yield
results that appear to violate quantum mechanics. The point is illustrated by
violation of the Soffer bound in $QCD$. Experimental confirmation that the
bound is violated would be a discovery of immense importance, sweeping away
fundamental assumptions of strong interaction physics held for the past 50
years.
