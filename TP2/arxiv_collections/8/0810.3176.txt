In this paper, an optimal switching problem is proposed for one-dimensional
reflected backward stochastic differential equations (RBSDEs, for short) where
the generators, the terminal values and the barriers are all switched with
positive costs. The value process is characterized by a system of
multi-dimensional RBSDEs with oblique reflection, whose existence and
uniqueness are by no means trivial and are therefore carefully examined.
Existence is shown using both methods of the Picard iteration and penalization,
but under some different conditions. Uniqueness is proved by representation
either as the value process to our optimal switching problem for
one-dimensional RBSDEs, or as the equilibrium value process to a stochastic
differential game of switching and stopping. Finally, the switched RBSDE is
interpreted as a real option.
