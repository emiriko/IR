For a variety of inter-related cultural, organizational, and political
reasons, progress in climate science and the actual solution of scientific
problems in this field have moved at a much slower rate than would normally be
possible. Not all these factors are unique to climate science, but the heavy
influence of politics has served to amplify the role of the other factors. Such
factors as the change in the scientific paradigm from a dialectic opposition
between theory and observation to an emphasis on simulation and observational
programs, the inordinate growth of administration in universities and the
consequent increase in importance of grant overhead, and the hierarchical
nature of formal scientific organizations are cosidered. This paper will deal
with the origin of the cultural changes and with specific examples of the
operation and interaction of these factors. In particular, we will show how
political bodies act to control scientific institutions, how scientists adjust
both data and even theory to accommodate politically correct positions, and how
opposition to these positions is disposed of.
