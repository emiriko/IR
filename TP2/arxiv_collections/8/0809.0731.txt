We study the topological properties of quantum states for the spinless
particle hopping in a Mobius ladder. This system can be regarded as a molecular
device possibly engineered from the aromatic Mobius annulenes, which enjoys a
pseudo-spin orbital interaction described by a non-Abelian gauge structure. It
results from the nontrivial topology of configuration space, and results in
various observable effects, such as optical spectral splitting. The
transmission spectrum through the Mobius molecular device is calculated to
demonstrate a topological effect as a destructive interferences in the
conduction band. The induced interaction also leads to an entanglement between
the transverse and longitudinal modes for any locally factorized state.
