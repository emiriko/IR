We present a uniform version of a result of M. Gromov on the surjunctivity of
maps commuting with expansive group actions and discuss several applications.
We prove in particular that for any group $\Gamma$ and any field $\K$, the
space of $\Gamma$-marked groups $G$ such that the group algebra $\K[G]$ is
stably finite is compact.
