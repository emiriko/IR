We discuss the problem of incorporating recoil effects into the probabilistic
QCD evolution scheme based on the picture of colour dipoles as done in recent
Monte Carlo programs. Such a scheme correctly describes subleading soft
contributions to multiplicity distributions. However we find that a simple
receipt for incorporating recoil effects into the dipole multiplication picture
conflicts the collinear factorization and does not lead to the correct DGLAP
equation.
