We study the self-similar solutions of any sign of the equation
u_{t}-div(|&#8711;u|^{p-2}&#8711;u)=|u|^{q-1}u, in R^{N}, where p,q>1. We
extend the results of Haraux-Weissler obtained for p=2 to the case q>p-1>0. In
particular we study the existence of slow or fast decaying solutions. For given
t>0, the fast solutions u(t,.) have a compact support in R^{N} when p>2, and
|x|^{p/(2-p)}u(t,x) is bounded at infinity when p<2. We describe the behaviour
for large |x| of all the solutions. According to the position of q with respect
to the first critical exponent p-1+p/N and the critical Sobolev exponent
q^{&#8727;}, we study the existence of positive solutions, or the number of the
zeros of u(t,.). We prove that any solution u(t,.) is oscillatory when p<2 and
q is closed to 1.
