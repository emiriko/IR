With the wide development of databases in general and data warehouses in
particular, it is important to reduce the tasks that a database administrator
must perform manually. The aim of auto-administrative systems is to
administrate and adapt themselves automatically without loss (or even with a
gain) in performance. The idea of using data mining techniques to extract
useful knowledge for administration from the data themselves has existed for
some years. However, little research has been achieved. This idea nevertheless
remains a very promising approach, notably in the field of data warehousing,
where queries are very heterogeneous and cannot be interpreted easily. The aim
of this study is to search for a way of extracting useful knowledge from stored
data themselves to automatically apply performance optimization techniques, and
more particularly indexing techniques. We have designed a tool that extracts
frequent itemsets from a given workload to compute an index configuration that
helps optimizing data access time. The experiments we performed showed that the
index configurations generated by our tool allowed performance gains of 15% to
25% on a test database and a test data warehouse.
