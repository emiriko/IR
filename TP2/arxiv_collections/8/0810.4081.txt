We present Hall effect, $R_{xy}(H)$, and magnetoresistance, $R_{xx}(H)$,
measurements of ultrathin films of Ni, Co and Fe with thicknesses varying
between 0.2-8 nm and resistances between 1 M$\Omega$ - 100 $\Omega.$ Both
measurements show that films having resistance above a critical value, $R_{C}$,
(thickness below a critical value, $d_{C}$) show no signs for ferromagnetism.
Ferromagnetism appears only for films with $R<R_{C}$, where $R_{C}$ is material
dependent. We raise the possibility that the reason for the absence of
spontaneous magnetization is suppression of itinerant ferromagnetism by
electronic disorder in the strong localization regime.
