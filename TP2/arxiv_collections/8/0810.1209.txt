We present an extensive analysis of low-energy, electroweak precision, and
cosmological constraints in the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM)
with Gauge-Mediated Supersymmetry Breaking (GMSB) and including the possibility
of Non-Minimal Flavour Violation (NMFV). Using detailed scans over the
parameter space, we show how NMFV allows to relax the stringent constraints
excluding large parts of the minimal GMSB. We define benchmark scenarios and
present numerical predictions for various sparticle production cross sections
at the LHC.
