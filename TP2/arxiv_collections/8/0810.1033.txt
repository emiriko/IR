As a serious attempt for constructing a new foundation for describing
micro-incidents from a local causal standpoint, I explained before that each
micro-entity can be assumed to be composed of a probability field joined to a
particle (called a particle-field or PF system) which is endowed with energy,
having an objective character. In this essay, some odd quantum phenomena
including the tunneling effect, the measurement problem and the EPR theorem are
reexamined in detail from the standpoint of the new theory.
