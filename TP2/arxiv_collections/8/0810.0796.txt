We report measurements of hadronic final states produced in $e^+e^-$
annihilations from the BaBar and Belle experiments. In particular, we present
cross sections measured in several different processes, including two-photon
physics, Initial-State Radiation, and exclusive hadron productions at
center-of-mass energies near 10.58 GeV. Results are compared with theoretical
predictions.
