New iron-arsenide superconductors of REFeAsO1-delta (RE = Ho, Y, Dy and Tb)
were successfully synthesized by a high pressure synthesizing method with a
special rapid quenching process, with the onset superconducting critical
temperatures at 50.3 K, 46.5 K, 52.2K and 48.5 K for RE = Ho, Y, Dy and Tb
respectively.
