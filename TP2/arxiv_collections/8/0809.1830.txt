FLASH plans to use a "third harmonic" (3.9GHz) superconducting cavity to
compensate nonlinear distortions of the longitudinal phase space due to the
sinusoidal curvature of the the cavity voltage of the TESLA 1.3GHz cavities.
Higher order modes (HOMs) in the 3.9GHz have a significant impact on the
dynamics of the electron bunches in a long bunch train. Kicks due to dipole
modes can be enhanced along the bunch train depending on the frequency and
Q-value of the modes. The enhancement factor for a constant beam offset with
respect to the cavity has been calculated. A simple Monte Carlo model of these
effects, allowing for scatter in HOM frequencies due to manufacturing
variances, has also been implemented and results for both FLASH and for an
XFEL-like configuration are presented.
