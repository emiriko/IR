We report measurements of transfer functions and flux shifts of 20 on-chip
high T$_C$ DC SQUIDs half of which were made purposely geometrically
asymmetric. All of these SQUIDs were fabricated using standard high T$_C$ thin
film technology and they were single layer ones, having 140 nm thickness of
YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-x}$ film deposited by laser ablation onto MgO bicrystal
substrates with 24$^0$ misorientation angle. For every SQUID the parameters of
its intrinsic asymmetry, i. e., the density of critical current and resistivity
of every junction, were measured directly and independently. We showed that the
main reason for the on-chip spreading of SQUIDs' voltage-current and
voltage-flux characteristics was the intrinsic asymmetry. We found that for
SQUIDs with a relative large inductance ($L>120 $ pH) both the voltage
modulation and the transfer function were not very sensitive to the junctions
asymmetry, whereas SQUIDs with smaller inductance ($L\simeq 65-75 $ pH) were
more sensitive. The results obtained in the paper are important for the
implementation in the sensitive instruments based on high T$_C$ SQUID arrays
and gratings.
