C points, that is isolated points of circular polarization in transverse
fields of varying polarization, are classified morphologically into three
distinct types, known as lemons, stars and monstars. These morphologies are
interpreted here according to two natural parameters associated with the
singularity, namely the anisotropy of the C point, and the polarization azimuth
on the anisotropy axis. In addition to providing insight into singularity
morphology, this observation applies to the densities of the various
morphologies in isotropic random polarization speckle fields.
