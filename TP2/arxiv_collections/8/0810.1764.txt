We present results for the QCD Equation of State (EoS) obtained using
simulations of lattice QCD at zero chemical potential. Our high statistics
results compare improved asqtad and p4fat3 staggered quarks on lattices with a
temporal extent N_tau = 6 and 8 and light quark masses approximately one fifth
and one tenth the strange quark mass. We find that the two actions give
consistent results and estimate that the trace anomaly (epsilon - 3p)/T^4
obtained on N_tau = 8 lattices represents the continuum value to better than
20% uncertainty over the temperature range 140-700 MeV. The precision in the
estimates of energy density and pressure are better, therefore, we conclude
that lattice estimates of the energy density and pressure should be used in the
phenomenological analysis of RHIC and LHC data. We also find a consistent
picture of the crossover temperature from all observables studied, with the
best estimated range to be 185-195 MeV. These calculations are being carried
out on the IBM BlueGene/L supercomputer at Lawrence Livermore National
Laboratory and at the New York Center for Computational Science (NYBlue).
