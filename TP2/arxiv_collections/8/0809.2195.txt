We consider Brox's model: a one-dimensional diffusion in a Brownian potential
W. We show that the normalized local time process (L(t;m_(log t) + x)=t; x \in
R), where m_(log t) is the bottom of the deepest valley reached by the process
before time t, behaves asymptotically like a process which only depends on W.
As a consequence, we get the weak convergence of the local time to a functional
of two independent three-dimensional Bessel processes and thus the limit law of
the supremum of the normalized local time. These results are discussed and
compared to the discrete time and space case which same questions have been
solved recently by N. Gantert, Y. Peres and Z. Shi.
