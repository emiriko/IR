We show that W H and Z H production where the Higgs boson decays to bbbar can
be recovered as good search channels for the Standard Model Higgs at the Large
Hadron Collider. This is done by requiring the Higgs to have high transverse
momentum, and employing state-of-the-art jet reconstruction and decomposition
techniques.
