Toric log del Pezzo surfaces correspond to convex lattice polygons containing
the origin in their interior and having only primitive vertices. An upper bound
on the volume and on the number of boundary lattice points of these polygons is
derived in terms of the index l. Techniques for classifying these polygons are
also described: a direct classification for index two is given, and a
classification for all l<17 is obtained.
