Full pattern Le-Bail refinement using x-ray powder diffraction profiles of
Sr1-xCaxTiO3 for x=0.02, 0.04 in the temperature range 12 to 300 K reveals
anomalies in the unit cell parameters at 170, 225 K due to an
antiferrodistortive (cubic to tetragonal I4/mcm) phase transition and at ~32,
~34 K due to a transition to a polar phase (tetragonal I4/mcm to orthorhombic
Ic2m), respectively. The lower transition temperatures obtained by us are in
excellent agreement with those reported on the basis of the dielectric studies
by Bednorz and Muller, [10] who attributed these to ferroelectric transition.
Rietveld analysis of the diffraction profiles of the polar phase reveals
off-centre displacements of both Sr2+/Ca2+ and Ti4+ ions in the X-Y plane along
<110> pseudocubic directions, in agreement with the experimentally reported
direction of easy polarization by Bednorz and Muller, but the resulting dipole
moments are shown to be ferrielectrically coupled in the neighbouring (001)
planes along the [001] direction leading to anomalously low values of the
spontaneous polarization at 12K.
