With suitable order of limits, as p, m, and n all tend to infinity, the
distribution of the normalized trace of Frobenius on H^1 of a "random" plane
curve of degree n over the field with p^m elements, tends to a Gaussian
distribution. The same is true of a "random" curve of genus g over the field
with p^m elements.
