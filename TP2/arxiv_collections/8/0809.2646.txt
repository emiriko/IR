We present a sheet structure that rotates the local ray direction through an
arbitrary angle around the sheet normal. The sheet structure consists of two
parallel Dove-prism sheets, each of which flips one component of the local
direction of transmitted light rays. Together, the two sheets rotate
transmitted light rays around the sheet normal. We show that the direction
under which a point light source is seen is given by a Mobius transform. We
illustrate some of the properties with movies calculated by ray-tracing
software.
