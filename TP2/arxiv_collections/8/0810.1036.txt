We demonstrate sympathetic cooling of a 43Ca+ trapped-ion "memory" qubit by a
40Ca+ "coolant" ion near the ground state of both axial motional modes, whilst
maintaining coherence of the qubit. This is an essential ingredient in
trapped-ion quantum computers. The isotope shifts are sufficient to suppress
decoherence and phase shifts of the memory qubit due to the cooling light which
illuminates both ions. We measure the qubit coherence during 10 cycles of
sideband cooling, finding a coherence loss of 3.3% per cooling cycle. The
natural limit of the method is O(0.01%) infidelity per cooling cycle.
