The Ginzburg-Landau equations for magnetic and gluomagnetic gauge fields of
the semi-superfluid strings in the color superconducting core of the neutron
star with diquark condensate in the color-flavor-locking (CFL) phase are
derived. The simultaneous coupling of the CFL diquark condensate to the
magnetic and gluomagnetic gauge fields is taken into account. The asymptotic
values of these string energies are defined from quantization conditions. It is
shown that a lattice of semi-superfluid strings with minimal quantum of
circulation emerges in the superconducting quark core during rotation of the
star. The magnetic field in the core of this string is of order of 10^18 G. The
cluster of proton vortices appeared in the hadronic phase around each
superfluid neutron vortex due to entrainment effect, creates in the
superconducting quark core new semi-superfluid strings with minimal quantum of
circulation.
