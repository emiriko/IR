Collaboration between small-scale wireless devices hinges on their ability to
infer properties shared across multiple nearby nodes. Wireless-enabled mobile
devices in particular create a highly dynamic environment not conducive to
distributed reasoning about such global properties. This paper addresses a
specific instance of this problem: distributed aggregation. We present
extensions to existing unstructured aggregation protocols that enable
estimation of count, sum, and average aggregates in highly dynamic
environments. With the modified protocols, devices with only limited
connectivity can maintain estimates of the aggregate, despite
\textit{unexpected} peer departures and arrivals. Our analysis of these
aggregate maintenance extensions demonstrates their effectiveness in
unstructured environments despite high levels of node mobility.
