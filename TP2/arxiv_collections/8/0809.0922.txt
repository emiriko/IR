Superposition is an established decision procedure for a variety of
first-order logic theories represented by sets of clauses. A satisfiable
theory, saturated by superposition, implicitly defines a minimal term-generated
model for the theory. Proving universal properties with respect to a saturated
theory directly leads to a modification of the minimal model's term-generated
domain, as new Skolem functions are introduced. For many applications, this is
not desired.
  Therefore, we propose the first superposition calculus that can explicitly
represent existentially quantified variables and can thus compute with respect
to a given domain. This calculus is sound and refutationally complete in the
limit for a first-order fixed domain semantics. For saturated Horn theories and
classes of positive formulas, we can even employ the calculus to prove
properties of the minimal model itself, going beyond the scope of known
superposition-based approaches.
