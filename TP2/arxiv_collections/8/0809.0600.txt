We consider the problem of deriving the no-signaling condition from the
assumption that, as seen from a complexity theoretic perspective, the universe
is not an exponential place. A fact that disallows such a derivation is the
existence of {\em polynomial superluminal} gates, hypothetical primitive
operations that enable superluminal signaling but not the efficient solution of
intractable problems. It therefore follows, if this assumption is a basic
principle of physics, either that it must be supplemented with additional
assumptions to prohibit such gates, or, improbably, that no-signaling is not a
universal condition. Yet, a gate of this kind is possibly implicit, though not
recognized as such, in a decade-old quantum optical experiment involving
position-momentum entangled photons. Here we describe a feasible modified
version experiment that appears to explicitly demonstrate the action of this
gate. Some obvious counter-claims are shown to be invalid. We believe that the
unexpected possibility of polynomial superluminal operations arises because
some practically measured quantum optical quantities are not describable as
standard quantum mechanical observables.
