In Part I we discuss accumulating experimental evidence related to the
structure and origin of the bosonic spectral function \alpha ^{2}F in
high-temperature superconducting (HTSC) cuprates near optimal doping. Some
global properties of \alpha ^{2}F such as number and positions of peaks, are
extracted by combining optics, neutron scattering, ARPES and tunnelling
measurements. These methods give convincing evidence for strong electron-phonon
interaction (EPI) with 1<\lambda \lesssim 3 in cuprates near optimal doping.
Here we clarify how these results are in favor of the Eliashberg-like theory
for HTSC cuprates near optimal doping.We argue that the neglect of EPI in some
previous studies of HTSC was based on a number of deceptive prejudices related
to the strength of EPI, on some physical misconceptions and misleading
interpretation of experimental results.
