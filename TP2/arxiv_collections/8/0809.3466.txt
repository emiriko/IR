We present a generalized POVM formalism for the calculation of quantum optics
networks of arbitrary complexity and apply it in a detailed analysis of the
Franson-Bell experiment. Our analysis suggests that when it comes to
observations of quantum processes, laboratory apparatus cannot always be used
according to classical principles.
