An integral lattice which is generated by some vectors of norm $q$ is called
$q$-lattice. Classification of 3-lattices of dimension at most four is given by
Mimura (On 3-lattice, 2006). As a expansion, we give a classification of
3-lattices of dimension at most seven. In addition, we consider the spherical
designs from its shells.
