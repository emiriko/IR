We show by a constructive proof that in all aperiodic dynamical system, for
all sequences $(a_n)_{n\in\N}\subset\R_+$ such that $a_n\nearrow\infty$ and
$\frac{a_n}{n}\to 0$ as $n\to\infty$, there exists a set $A\in\A$ having the
property that the sequence of the distributions of
$(\frac{1}{a_{n}}S_{n}(\ind_A-\mu(A)))_{n\in\N}$ is dense in the space of all
probability measures on $\R$.
