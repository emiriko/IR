We develop an analytical model of correlated two-electron ionization in
strong infrared laser fields. The model includes all relevant interactions
between the electrons, the laser field, and the ionic core nonperturbatively.
We focus on the deeply quantum regime, where the energy of the active electron
driven by the laser field is insufficient to collisionally ionize the parent
ion, and the assistance of the laser field is required to create a doubly
charged ion. In this regime, the electron-electron and the electron-ion
interactions leave distinct footprints in the correlated two-electron spectra,
recording the mutual dynamics of the escaping electrons.
