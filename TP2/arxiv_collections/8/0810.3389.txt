First-principles calculations of the magnetic anisotropy energy for Mn- and
Fe-atoms on CuN/Cu(001) surface are performed making use of the torque method.
The easy magnetization direction is found to be different for Mn and Fe atoms
in accord with the experiment. It is shown the magnetic anisotropy has a
single-ion character and mainly originates from the local magnetic moment of
Mn- and Fe-atoms. The uniaxial magnetic anisotropy constants are calculated in
reasonable agreement with the experiment.
