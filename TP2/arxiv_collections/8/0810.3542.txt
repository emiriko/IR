In this paper it is shown how to obtain the simplest equations for the
Mukhanov-Sasaki variables describing quantum linear scalar perturbations in the
case of scalar fields without potential term. This was done through the
implementation of canonical transformations at the classical level, and unitary
transformations at the quantum level, without ever using any classical
background equation, and it completes the simplification initiated in
investigations by Langlois \cite{langlois}, and Pinho and Pinto-Neto
\cite{emanuel2} for this case. These equations were then used to calculate the
spectrum index $n_s$ of quantum scalar perturbations of a non-singular
inflationary quantum background model, which starts at infinity past from flat
space-time with Planckian size spacelike hypersurfaces, and inflates due to a
quantum cosmological effect, until it makes an analytical graceful exit from
this inflationary epoch to a decelerated classical stiff matter expansion
phase. The result is $n_s=3$, incompatible with observations.
