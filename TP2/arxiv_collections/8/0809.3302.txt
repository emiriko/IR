The symplectic wavelet transformation [Opt. Lett. 31 (2006) 3432], which is
related to quantum optical Fresnel transform, is developed to the
symplectic-dilation mixed wavelet transform (SDWT). The SDWT involves both a
real-variable dilation-transform and a complex-variable symplectic transform,
and possesses well-behaved properties such as Parseval theorem and inversion
formula. The entangled-coherent state representation (ESCR) not only underlies
the SDWT, but also helps to derive the corresponding quantum transform operator
whose counterpart in classical optics is the lens-Fresnel mixed transform
[Phys. Lett. A 357 (2006) 163].
