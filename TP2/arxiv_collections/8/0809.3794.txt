Classical conformal invariance of QCD in the chiral limit is broken
explicitly by scale anomaly. As a result, the lightest scalar particle (scalar
glueball, or dilaton) in QCD is not light, and cannot be described as a
Goldstone boson. Nevertheless basing on an effective low-energy theory of
broken scale invariance we argue that inside the hadrons the non-perturbative
interactions of gluon fields result in the emergence of a massless dilaton
excitation (which we call the "scalaron"). We demonstrate that our effective
theory of broken scale invariance leads to confinement. This theory allows a
dual formulation as a classical Yang-Mills theory on a curved conformal
space-time background. Possible applications are discussed, including the
description of strongly coupled quark-gluon plasma and the spin structure of
hadrons.
