This paper is devoted to the scattering of photons at electrons in models of
non-relativistic quantum mechanical particles coupled minimally to the soft
modes of the quantized electromagnetic field. We prove existence of scattering
states involving an arbitrary number of asymptotic photons of arbitrarily high
energy. Previously, upper bounds on the photon energies seemed necessary in the
case of $n>1$ asymptotic photons and non-confined, non-relativistic charged
particles.
