We study the resonant Casimir--Polder potential of an excited atom near a
half space containing magneto-electric meta-material of various kinds on the
basis of macroscopic quantum electrodynamics. Analytical results are obtained
in the nonretarded and retarded distance regimes and numerical examples are
given. We compare our findings with the potential of an excited atom near a
left-handed superlens.
