Domain specific software architecture aims at software reuse through
construction of domain architecture reference model. The constructed reference
model presents a set of individual components and their interaction points.
When starting on a new large software project, the design engineer starts with
pre-constructed model, which can be easily browsed and picks up opportunities
of use in the new solution design. This report discusses application of domain
reference design methods by deriving domain specific reference architecture for
a product ordering system in a design center. The product in this case is
instock and special order blinds from different manufacturers in a large supply
store. The development of mature domain specific reference software
architecture for this domain is not the objective of this report. However, this
report would like to capture the method used in one such process and that is
the primary concern of this report. This report lists subjective details of
such a process applied to the domain of ordering custom and instock blinds from
a large home construction and goods supply store. This report also describes
the detailed process of derivation of knowledge models, unified knowledge
models and the reference architecture for this domain. However, this domain
model is only partially complete which may not be used for any real
applications. This report is a result of a course project undertaken while
studying this methodology.
