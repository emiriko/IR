We present a technique capable of producing subwavelength focal spots in the
far-field of the source in planar non-resonant structures. The approach
combines the diffraction gratings that generate the high-wavevector-number
modes and planar slabs of homogeneous anisotropic metamaterials that propagate
these waves and combine them at the subwavelength focal spots. In a sense, the
technique combines the benefits of Fresnel lens, near-field zone plates,
hyperlens, and superlens, and at the same time resolves their fundamental
limitations. Several realizations of the proposed technique for visible,
near-IR, and mid-IR frequencies are proposed, and their performance is analyzed
theoretically and numerically. Generalization of the developed approach for
sub-diffractional on-chip photonics is suggested.
