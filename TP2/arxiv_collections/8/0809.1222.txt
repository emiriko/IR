By using the finite temperature quantum field theory, we calculate the finite
temperature effective potential and extend the improved quark mass
density-dependent model to finite temperature. It is shown that this model can
not only describe the saturation properties of nuclear matter, but also explain
the quark deconfinement phase transition successfully. The critical temperature
is given and the effect of $\omega$- meson is addressed.
