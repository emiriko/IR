Braverman and Finkelberg recently proposed the geometric Satake
correspondence for the affine Kac-Moody group $G_\aff$ [Braverman A.,
Finkelberg M., arXiv:0711.2083]. They conjecture that intersection cohomology
sheaves on the Uhlenbeck compactification of the framed moduli space of
$G_{\mathrm{cpt}}$-instantons on $\R^4/\Z_r$ correspond to weight spaces of
representations of the Langlands dual group $G_\aff^\vee$ at level $r$. When $G
= \SL(l)$, the Uhlenbeck compactification is the quiver variety of type
$\algsl(r)_\aff$, and their conjecture follows from the author's earlier result
and I. Frenkel's level-rank duality. They further introduce a convolution
diagram which conjecturally gives the tensor product multiplicity [Braverman
A., Finkelberg M., Private communication, 2008]. In this paper, we develop the
theory for the branching in quiver varieties and check this conjecture for
$G=\SL(l)$.
