The presence of spin-orbit (SO) interaction in a noncentrosymmetric
superconductor, La2C3 (T_c~11 K) is demonstrated by muon spin rotation (muSR)
in its normal state, where muSR spectra exhibit field-induced weak
depolarization due to van Vleck-like local susceptibility. In the mixed state,
muon spin relaxation due to inhomogeneity of internal field (sigma_v) exhibits
a field dependence that is characterized by a kink, where sigma_v (and hence
the superfluid density) is more strongly reduced at lower fields. This is
perfectly in line with the presence of a secondary energy gap previously
inferred from the temperature dependence of sigma_v, and also consistent with
the possible influence of asymmetric deformation of the Fermi surface due to
the SO interaction.
