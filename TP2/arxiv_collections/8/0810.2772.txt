Experiments on several novel superconducting compounds have observed
oscillations of the specific heat when an applied magnetic field is rotated
with respect to the crystal axes. The results are commonly interpreted as
arising from the nodes of an unconventional order parameter, but the
identifications of nodal directions are sometimes controversial. Here we show
with a semiclassical model calculation that when the magnetic field points in
the direction of the nodes, either minima or maxima can occur in the specific
heat depending on the the temperature $T$ and the magnetic field $H$. An
inversion of the angular oscillations takes place with respect to those
predicted earlier at low temperature by the nodal approximation.
  This result, together with the argument that the inversion takes place based
on an approximation valid at moderate fields, indicates that the inversion of
specific heat oscillations is an intrinsic feature of nodal superconductors.
