The polar curves of foliations $\mathcal F$ having a curve $C$ of
separatrices generalize the classical polar curves associated to hamiltonian
foliations of $C$. As in the classical theory, the equisingularity type
${\wp}({\mathcal F})$ of a generic polar curve depends on the analytical type
of ${\mathcal F}$, and hence of $C$. In this paper we find the equisingularity
types $\epsilon (C)$ of $C$, that we call kind singularities, such that
${\wp}({\mathcal F})$ is completely determined by $\epsilon (C)$ for
Zariski-general foliations $\mathcal F$. Our proofs are mainly based on the
adjunction properties of the polar curves. The foliation-like framework is
necessary, otherwise we do not get the right concept of general foliation in
Zariski sense and, as we show by examples, the hamiltonian case can be out of
the set of general foliations.
