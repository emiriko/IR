A fast impurity solver for the dynamical mean field theory(DMFT) named Two
Mode Approxi- mation (TMA) is proposed based on the Gutzwiller variational
approach, which captures the main features of both the coherent and incoherent
motion of the electrons. The new solver works with real frequency at zero
temperature and it provides directly the spectral function of the electrons. It
can be easily generalized to multi-orbital impurity problems with general
on-site interactions, which makes it very useful in LDA+DMFT. Benchmarks on one
and two band Hubbard models are presented, and the results agree well with
those of Exact Diagonalization (ED).
