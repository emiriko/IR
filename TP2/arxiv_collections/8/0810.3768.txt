We consider tan(beta)-enhanced quantum effects in the minimal supersymmetric
standard model (MSSM) including those from the Higgs sector. To this end, we
match the MSSM to an effective two-Higgs doublet model (2HDM), assuming that
all SUSY particles are heavy, and calculate the coefficients of the operators
that vanish or are suppressed in the MSSM at tree-level. Our result clarifies
the dependence of the large-tan(beta) resummation on the renormalization
convention for tan(beta), and provides analytic expressions for the Yukawa and
trilinear Higgs interactions. The numerical effect is analyzed by means of a
parameter scan, and we find that the Higgs-sector effects, where present, are
typically larger than those from the "wrong-Higgs" Yukawa couplings in the
2HDM.
