A description of phase separation kinetics for solid binary (A,B) mixtures in
thin film geometry based on the Kawasaki spin-exchange kinetic Ising model is
presented in a discrete lattice molecular field formulation. It is shown that
the model describes the interplay of wetting layer formation and lateral phase
separation, which leads to a characteristic domain size $\ell(t)$ in the
directions parallel to the confining walls that grows according to the
Lifshitz-Slyozov $t^{1/3}$ law with time $t$ after the quench. Near the
critical point of the model, the description is shown to be equivalent to the
standard treatments based on Ginzburg-Landau models. Unlike the latter, the
present treatment is reliable also at temperatures far below criticality, where
the correlation length in the bulk is only of the order of a lattice spacing,
and steep concentration variations may occur near the walls, invalidating the
gradient square approximation. A further merit is that the relation to the
interaction parameters in the bulk and at the walls is always transparent, and
the correct free energy at low temperatures is consistent with the time
evolution by construction.
