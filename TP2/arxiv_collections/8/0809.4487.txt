We perform a model-independent study for top-antitop and top-top resonances
in the dilepton channel at the Large Hadtron Collider. In this channel, we can
solve the kinematic system to obtain the momenta of all particles including the
two neutrinos, and hence the resonance mass and spin. For discovering
top-antitop resonances, the dilepton channel is competitive to the semileptonic
channel because of the good resolution of lepton momentum measurement and small
standard model backgrounds. Moreover, the charges of the two leptons can be
identified, which makes the dilepton channel advantageous for discovering
top-top resonances and for distinguishing resonance spins. We discuss and
provide resolutions for difficulties associated with heavy resonances and
highly boosted top quarks.
