Over a decade since the discovery of the top quark we are still trying to
unravel mysteries of the heaviest observed particle and learn more about its
nature. The continuously accumulating statistics of CDF and Dzero data provide
the means for measuring top quark properties with ever greater precision and
the opportunity to search for signs of new physics that could be manifested
through subtle deviations from the standard model in the production and decays
of top quarks. In the following we present a slice of the rich program in top
quark physics at the Fermilab Tevatron: measurements of the properties of top
quark decays and searches for unusual phenomena in events with pair produced
tops. In particular, we discuss the most recent and precise CDF and Dzero
measurements of the transverse polarization of W bosons from top decays,
branching ratios and searches for flavor-changing neutral current decays,
decays into charged Higgs and invisible decays. These analyses correspond to
integrated luminosities ranging from 0.9 to 2.7 inv. fb.
