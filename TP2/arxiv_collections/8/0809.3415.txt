This paper presents a capture of the queries managed by an eDonkey server
during almost 10 weeks, leading to the observation of almost 9 billion messages
involving almost 90 million users and more than 275 million distinct files.
Acquisition and management of such data raises several challenges, which we
discuss as well as the solutions we developed. We obtain a very rich dataset,
orders of magnitude larger than previously avalaible ones, which we provide for
public use. We finally present basic analysis of the obtained data, which
already gives evidence of non-trivial features.
