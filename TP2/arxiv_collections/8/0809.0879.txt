We use lattice QCD simulations to test some of the predictions of proposed
AdS/QCD (holographic) duals for QCD. In particular, these duals predict that
the scale of chiral symmetry breaking ($\chi$SB) can be varied independently
from that of confinement, with the proviso that the scale of $\chi$SB cannot be
longer than that of confinement. We simulate lattice QCD with 2 quarks in the
fundamental representation of colour and with additional 4-fermion interactions
(suggested by AdS/QCD), at finite temperatures. For sufficiently strong
4-fermion interactions, the deconfinement and $\chi$SB transitions occur at
different temperatures, the separation depending on the 4-fermion coupling.
This confirms that the scales of confinement and $\chi$SB are, in general,
different.
