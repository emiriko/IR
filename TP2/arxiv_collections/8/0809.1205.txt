With the analysis of the hierarchical scheme, the potential influence of the
pre-constant in deriving scaling laws is exposed. It is found that a modified
hierarchical scheme can achieve a throughput arbitrarily times higher than the
original one, although it is still diminishingly small compared to the linear
scaling. The study demonstrates the essential importance of the throughput
formula itself, rather than the scaling laws consequently derived.
