Randomly-connected networks of integrate-and-fire (IF) neurons are known to
display asynchronous irregular (AI) activity states, which resemble the
discharge activity recorded in the cerebral cortex of awake animals. However,
it is not clear whether such activity states are specific to simple IF models,
or if they also exist in networks where neurons are endowed with complex
intrinsic properties similar to electrophysiological measurements. Here, we
investigate the occurrence of AI states in networks of nonlinear IF neurons,
such as the adaptive exponential IF (Brette-Gerstner-Izhikevich) model. This
model can display intrinsic properties such as low-threshold spike (LTS),
regular spiking (RS) or fast-spiking (FS). We successively investigate the
oscillatory and AI dynamics of thalamic, cortical and thalamocortical networks
using such models. AI states can be found in each case, sometimes with
surprisingly small network size of the order of a few tens of neurons. We show
that the presence of LTS neurons in cortex or in thalamus, explains the robust
emergence of AI states for relatively small network sizes. Finally, we
investigate the role of spike-frequency adaptation (SFA). In cortical networks
with strong SFA in RS cells, the AI state is transient, but when SFA is
reduced, AI states can be self-sustained for long times. In thalamocortical
networks, AI states are found when the cortex is itself in an AI state, but
with strong SFA, the thalamocortical network displays Up and Down state
transitions, similar to intracellular recordings during slow-wave sleep or
anesthesia. Self-sustained Up and Down states could also be generated by
two-layer cortical networks with LTS cells. These models suggest that intrinsic
properties such as LTS are crucial for AI states in thalamocortical networks.
