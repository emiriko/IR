In this study, we reproduce two new hybrid intelligent systems, involve three
prominent intelligent computing and approximate reasoning methods: Self
Organizing feature Map (SOM), Neruo-Fuzzy Inference System and Rough Set Theory
(RST),called SONFIS and SORST. We show how our algorithms can be construed as a
linkage of government-society interactions, where government catches various
states of behaviors: solid (absolute) or flexible. So, transition of society,
by changing of connectivity parameters (noise) from order to disorder is
inferred.
