We study the electronic structure and magnetism of 25% Mn substituted cubic
Zirconia (ZrO2) with several homogeneous and heterogeneous doping profiles
using density-functional theory calculations. We find that all doping profiles
show half-metallic ferromagnetism (HMF), and delta-doping is most energy
favorable while homogeneous doping has largest ferromagnetic stabilization
energy. Using crystal field theory, we discuss the formation scheme of HMF.
Finally, we speculate the potential spintronics applications for Mn doped ZrO2,
especially as spin direction controllment.
