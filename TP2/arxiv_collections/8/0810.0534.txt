An optical transmitter irradiates a target region containing a bright
thermal-noise bath in which a low-reflectivity object might be embedded. The
light received from this region is used to decide whether the object is present
or absent. The performance achieved using a coherent-state transmitter is
compared with that of a quantum illumination transmitter, i.e., one that
employs the signal beam obtained from spontaneous parametric downconversion
(SPDC). By making the optimum joint measurement on the light received from the
target region together with the retained SPDC idler beam, the quantum
illumination system realizes a 6 dB advantage in error probability exponent
over the optimum reception coherent-state system. This advantage accrues
despite there being no entanglement between the light collected from the target
region and the retained idler beam.
