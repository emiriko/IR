We express the matroid polytope $P_M$ of a matroid $M$ as a signed Minkowski
sum of simplices, and obtain a formula for the volume of $P_M$. This gives a
combinatorial expression for the degree of an arbitrary torus orbit closure in
the Grassmannian $Gr_{k,n}$. We then derive analogous results for the
independent set polytope and the associated flag matroid polytope of $M$. Our
proofs are based on a natural extension of Postnikov's theory of generalized
permutohedra.
