Recent Letter by V. B. Svetovoy [Phys. Rev. Lett. v.101, 163603 (2008),
arXiv:0809.3901] claims that the Lifshitz theory combined with spatially
nonlocal dielectric permittivities is consistent with the experimental data and
Nernst's theorem. We prove that these claims are incorrect. They are based on
irregular comparison with the data and misinterpretation of relevant physical
quantities.
