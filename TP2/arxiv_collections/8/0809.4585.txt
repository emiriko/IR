Starting from the Caldeira-Leggett (CL) model, we derive the equation
describing the Quantum Brownian motion, which has been originally proposed by
Dekker purely from phenomenological basis containing extra anomalous diffusion
terms. Explicit analytical expressions for the temperature dependence of the
diffusion constants are derived. At high temperatures, additional momentum
diffusion terms are suppressed and classical Langivin equation can be recovered
and at the same time positivity of the density matrix(DM) is satisfied. At low
temperatures, the diffusion constants have a finite positive value, however,
below a certain critical temperature, the Master Equation(ME) does not satisfy
the positivity condition as proposed by Dekker.
