We present a theoretical description of the phase dynamics and its
corresponding electrodynamics in a stack of inductively coupled intrinsic
Josephson junctions of layered high-$T_c$ superconductors in the absence of an
external magnetic field. Depending on the spatial structure of the gauge
invariant phase difference, the dynamic state is classified into: state with
kink, state without kink, and state with solitons. It is revealed that in the
state with phase kink, the plasma is coupled to the cavity and the plasma
oscillation is enhanced. In contrast, in the state without kink, the plasma
oscillation is weak. It points a way to enhance the radiation of
electromagnetic from high-$T_c$ superconductors. We also perform numerical
simulations to check the theory and a good agreement is achieved. The radiation
pattern of the state with and without kink is calculated, which may serve as a
fingerprint of the dynamic state realized by the system. At last, the power
radiation of the state with solitons is calculated by simulations. The possible
state realized in the recent experiments is discussed in the viewpoint of the
theoretical description. The state with kink is important for applications
including terahertz generators and amplifiers.
