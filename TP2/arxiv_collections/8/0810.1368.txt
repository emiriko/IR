Using time domain measurements, we assess the feasibility of time-reversal
technique in ultra-wideband (UWB) communication. A typical indoor propagation
channel is selected for the exploration. The channel response between receive
and transmit antenna pairs is measured using time domain equipments which
include an arbitrary wave generator (AWG) and a digital storage oscilloscope
(DSO). The time-reversed version of the channel response is constructed with
AWG and re-transmitted in the channel. The equivalent time reversed channel
response is recorded. The properties of the time reversal technique in the line
of sight (LOS) co-polar and cross-polar scenarios are measured.
