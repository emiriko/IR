Our present knowledge of neutrinos can be summarized in terms of the
"standard neutrino scenario". Phenomenology of this scenario as well as
attempts to uncover physics behind neutrino mass and mixing are described.
Goals of future studies include complete reconstruction of the neutrino mass
and flavor spectrum, further test of the standard scenario and search for new
physics beyond it. Developments of new experimental techniques may lead to
construction of new neutrino detectors from table-top to multi-Megaton scales
which will open new horizons in the field. With detection of neutrino bursts
from the Galactic supernova and high energy cosmic neutrinos neutrino
astrophysics will enter qualitatively new phase. Neutrinos and LHC (and future
colliders), neutrino astronomy, neutrino structure of the Universe, and
probably, neutrino technologies will be among leading topics of research.
