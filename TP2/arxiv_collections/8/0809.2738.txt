We give a conceptual proof that the Poincar\'e series of the coordinate
algebra of a Kleinian singularity and of a Fuchsian singularity of genus 0 is
the quotient of the characteristic polynomials of two Coxeter elements. These
Coxeter elements are interpreted geometrically, using triangulated categories
and spherical twist functors.
