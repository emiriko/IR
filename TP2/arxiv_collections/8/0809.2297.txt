Oxygen was systematically incorporated in MBE grown MgB2 films using in-situ
post-growth anneals in an oxygen environment. Connectivity analysis in
combination with measurements of the critical temperature and resistivity
indicate that oxygen is distributed both within and between the grains. High
values of critical current densities in field (~4x10^5 A/cm^2 at 8 T and 4.2
K), extrabolated critical fields (>45 T) and slopes of critical field versus
temperature (1.4 T/K) are observed. Our results suggest that low growth
temperatures (300oC) and oxygen doping (>0.65%) can produce MgB2 with high Jc
values in field and Hc2 for high-field magnet applications.
