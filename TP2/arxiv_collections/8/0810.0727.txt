Finite Unified Theories (FUTs) are N=1 supersymmetric Grand Unified Theories
(GUTs) which can be made finite to all-loop orders, leading to a drastic
reduction in the number of free parameters. By confronting the predictions of
SU(5) FUTs with the top and bottom quark masses we are able to discriminate
among different models. Including further low-energy phenomenology constraints,
such as B physics observables, the bound on the SM Higgs mass and the cold dark
matter density, we derive predictions for the lightest Higgs boson mass and the
sparticle spectrum.
