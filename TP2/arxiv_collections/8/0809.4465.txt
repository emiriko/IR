The clock paradox is analyzed for the case when the onward and return trips
cover the same <<distance>> (as observed by the traveling twin) but at unequal
velocities. In this case the stationary twin observes the distances covered by
her sister during the onward and return trips to be different. The analysis is
presented using formulations of special relativity and the only requirement for
consistency is that all observations are made from any one chosen inertial
frame. The analysis suggests that a defining feature of an inertial frame
should be based on the continued maintenance of the distinctive synchronicity
of the clocks co-moving with it. Published in Journal of Physical and Natural
