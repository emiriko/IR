The interpretation of the J/psi suppression patterns observed in nuclear
collisions, at CERN and RHIC, as a signature of the formation of a deconfined
phase of QCD matter, requires knowing which fractions of the measured J/psi
yields, in pp collisions, are due to decays of heavier charmonium states. From
a detailed analysis of the available mid-rapidity charmonium hadro-production
cross sections, or their ratios, we determine that the J/psi feed-down
contributions from psi' and chi_c decays are, respectively, (8.1 +/- 0.3) % and
(25 +/- 5) %. These proton-proton values are derived from global averages of
the proton-nucleus measurements, assuming that the charmonium states are
exponentially absorbed with the length of matter they traverse in the nuclear
targets.
