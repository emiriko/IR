Given an efficient and systematic method for generating input sets for free
fermionic heterotic model building we consider what the realistic bounds are
for a statistical analysis of the free fermionic Landscape with a classical
computer. We then consider what kind of improvement could be expected on a
quantum computer. We do outline the basic structure of the relevant quantum
algorithms, but we do not detail the construction of the oracle which would be
involved in the calculations.
