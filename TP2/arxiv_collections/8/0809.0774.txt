We have investigated the tunable lateral shift and polarization beam
splitting of the transmitted light beam through electro-optic crystals, based
on the Pockels effect. The positive and negative lateral shifts could be easily
controlled by adjusting the permittivity tensor, which is modulated by the
external applied electric field. An alternative way to realize the polarization
beam splitter was also proposed by the polarization-dependent lateral shifts.
Numerical simulations for Gaussian-shaped incident beam have demonstrated the
above theoretical results obtained by stationary phase method. All these
phenomena have potential applications in optical devices.
