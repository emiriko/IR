The trivalent alkali fullerides A$_3$C$_{60}$, where C$_{60}$ are a well
established family of molecular superconductors. The electron pairing has
s-wave symmetry and is due to standard electron-phonon coupling, in particular
by Jahn-Teller intramolecular C$_{60}$ vibrations.
  A source of renewed interest in these systems are indications of strong
electron-electron repulsion, which emerges especially in compounds where the
C$_{60}$-C$_{60}$ distance is expanded. In several compounds after an initial
increases T$_c$, further expansions leads to a decline of superconductivity and
its eventual disappearance in favor of a Mott insulating state
  We theoretically study a three-orbital Hubbard model including the
phonon-mediated interaction using Dynamical Mean-Field Theory, which is
particularly suitable due to the local nature of all the interactions. We
studied the system as a function of the ratio of intra-molecular repulsion $U$
over the electron bandwidth $W$, the increase of $U/W$ representing the main
effect of lattice expansion. The phase diagram is close to that of actual
materials, with a dome-shaped superconducting region preceding the Mott
transition. Unconventional properties predicted by this model include: (i) a
pseudogap in the normal phase; (ii) a gain of kinetic energy and of d.c.
conductivity at the onset of superconductivity; (iii) regular spin
susceptibility and specific heat despite strong correlations; (iv) the
emergence of more than one energy scale governing the renormalized single
particle dispersion. These predictions, if confirmed, would establish
fullerides, especially the expanded ones, as members of the wider family of
strongly correlated superconductors.
