We generalize the momentum average (MA) approximation to study the properties
of models with momentum-dependent electron-phonon coupling. As in the case of
the application of the original MA to the Holstein model, the results are
analytical, numerically trivial to evaluate, exact for both zero bandwidth and
for zero electron-phonon coupling, and are accurate everywhere in parameter
space. Comparison with available numerical data confirms this accuracy. We then
show that further improvements can be obtained based on variational
considerations, using the one-dimensional breathing-mode Hamiltonian as a
specific example. For example, by using this variational MA, we obtain ground
state energies within at most 0.3% error of the numerical data.
