Wide bandgap semiconductors are attractive candidates for polariton-based
devices operating at room temperature. We present numerical simulations of
reflectivity, transmission and absorption spectra of bulk GaAs, GaN and ZnO
microcavities, in order to compare the particularities of the strong coupling
regime in each system. Indeed the intrinsic properties of the excitons in these
materials result in a different hierarchy of energies between the valence-band
splitting, the effective Rydberg and the Rabi energy, defining the
characteristics of the exciton-polariton states independently of the quality
factor of the cavity. The knowledge of the composition of the polariton
eigenstates is central to optimize such systems. We demonstrate that, in ZnO
bulk microcavities, only the lower polaritons are good eigenstates and all
other resonances are damped, whereas upper polaritons can be properly defined
in GaAs and GaN microcavities.
