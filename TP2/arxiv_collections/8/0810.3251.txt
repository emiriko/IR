We discuss thermalization of a test particle schematized as a harmonic
oscillator and coupled to a Boltzmann heat bath of finite size and with a
finite bandwidth for the frequencies of its particles. We find that complete
thermalization only occurs when the test particle frequency is within a certain
range of the bath particle frequencies, and for a certain range of mass ratios
between the test particle and the bath particles. These results have
implications for the study of classical and quantum behaviour of high-frequency
nanomechanical resonators.
