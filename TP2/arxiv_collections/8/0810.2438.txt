MgB2 monofilamentary nickel-sheated tapes and wires were fabricated by means
of the ex-situ powder-in-tube method using either high-energy ball milled and
low temperature synthesized powders. All sample were sintered at 920 C in Ar
flow. The milling time and the revolution speed were tuned in order to maximize
the critical current density in field (Jc): the maximum Jc value of 6 x 10e4
A/cm2 at 5 K and 4 T was obtained corresponding to the tape prepared with
powders milled for 144h at 180rpm. Vorious synthesis temperature were also
investigated (730-900 C) finding a best Jc value for the wire prepared with
powders synthesized at 745 C. We speculate that this optimal temperature is due
to the fluidifying effect of unreacted magnesium content before the sintering
process which could better connect the grains.
