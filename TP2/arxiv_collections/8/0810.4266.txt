The author investigates the manipulation of thermal emission by using
one-dimensional tungsten gratings with different groove depths. It is found
that, by systematically increasing the depth of the groove, the linearly
polarized emission at particular frequencies can be substantially enhanced to
achieve that of the blackbody radiation limit, whereas the emission in other
frequency ranges shows no noticeable changes. The results can provide useful
insights into the design of thermovoltaic applications.
