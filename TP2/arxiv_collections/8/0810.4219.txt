The possibility of quantum transmission of information via the induced
fractional angular momentum by the Aharonov - Bohm vector potential is
revealed. Its special advantage is that it is noiseless: Stray magnetic fields
of environments influence the energy spectrum of the ion, but cannot contribute
the fractional angular momentum to cause noise.
