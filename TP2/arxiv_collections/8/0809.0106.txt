We discuss interfaces in spin glasses. We present new theoretical results and
a numerical method to characterize overlap interfaces and the stability of the
spin-glass phase in extended disordered systems. We use this definition to
characterize the low temperature phase of hierarchical spin-glass models. We
use the Replica Symmetry Breaking theory to evaluate the cost for an overlap
interface, which in these models is particularly simple. A comparison of our
results from numerical simulations with the theoretical predictions shows good
agreement.
