The optimal discrimination of non-orthogonal quantum states with minimum
error probability is a fundamental task in quantum measurement theory as well
as an important primitive in optical communication. In this work, we propose
and experimentally realize a new and simple quantum measurement strategy
capable of discriminating two coherent states with smaller error probabilities
than can be obtained using the standard measurement devices; the Kennedy
receiver and the homodyne receiver.
