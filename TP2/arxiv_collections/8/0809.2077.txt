We extend the traditional formulation of Gauge Field Theory by incorporating
the (non-Abelian) gauge group parameters (traditionally simple spectators) as
new dynamical (nonlinear-sigma-model-type) fields. These new fields interact
with the usual Yang-Mills fields through a generalized minimal coupling
prescription, which resembles the so-called Stueckelberg transformation, but
for the non-Abelian case. Here we study the case of internal gauge symmetry
groups, in particular, unitary groups U(N). We show how to couple standard
Yang-Mills Theory to Nonlinear-Sigma Models on cosets of U(N): complex
projective, Grassman and flag manifolds. These different couplings lead to
distinct (chiral) symmetry breaking patterns and \emph{Higgs-less}
mass-generating mechanisms for Yang-Mills fields.
