We study the control of noise-induced spatio-temporal current density
patterns in a semiconductor nanostructure (double barrier resonant tunnelling
diode) by multiple time-delayed feedback. We find much more pronounced resonant
features of noise-induced oscillations compared to single time feedback,
rendering the system more sensitive to variations in the delay time $\tau$. The
coherence of noise-induced oscillations measured by the correlation time
exhibits sharp resonances as a function of $\tau$, and can be strongly
increased by optimal choices of $\tau$. Similarly, the peaks in the power
spectral density are sharpened. We provide analytical insight into the control
mechanism by relating the correlation times and mean frequencies of
noise-induced breathing oscillations to the stability properties of the
deterministic stationary current density filaments under the influence of the
control loop. Moreover, we demonstrate that the use of multiple time delays
enlarges the regime in which the deterministic dynamical properties of the
system are not changed by delay-induced bifurcations.
