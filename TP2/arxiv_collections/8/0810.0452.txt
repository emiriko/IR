We report on the calculation of the next-to-leading order QCD corrections to
the production of top--antitop-quark pairs in association with a hard jet at
the Tevatron and at the LHC. Results for integrated and differential cross
sections are presented. We find a significant reduction of the scale
dependence. In most cases the corrections are below 20% indicating that the
perturbative expansion is well under control. Moreover, the forward--backward
charge asymmetry of the top-quark, which is analyzed at the Tevatron, is
studied at next-to-leading order. We find large corrections suggesting that the
definition of the observable has to be refined.
