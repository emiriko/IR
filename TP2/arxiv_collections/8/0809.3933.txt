We present results for the renormalized Polyakov loop in the three lowest
irreducible representations of SU(2) gauge theory at finite temperature. We
will discuss their scaling behavior near $T_c$ and test Casimir scaling in the
deconfined phase. Moreover, we will compare these results to calculations for
the renormalized Polyakov loops in several representations in the SU(3) gauge
theory.
