We point out that results obtained by M. Ribaric and L. Sustersic,
hep-th/0403084, and by M. Blasone, P. Jizba and H. Kleinert, quant-ph/0409021,
suggest that the path-integral formalism is the key to a derivation of quantum
physics from classical, deterministic physics in the four-dimensional
space-time. These results and the 't Hooft conjecture, hep-th/0104219, suggest
to consider a relativistic, non-material medium, an ether, as a base for
non-local hidden-variable models of the physical universe.
