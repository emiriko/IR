We study the flavour sector in models where the three families of matter are
unified in a $(16,3)$ representation of the $SO(10)\times A_4$ group. The
necessary ingredients to realize tri-bi-maximal mixing in the lepton sector are
identified systematically. The non-renormalizable operators contributing to the
fermion mass matrices play an important role. We also present a mechanism to
explain the inter-family mass hierarchy of quarks and charged leptons, which
relies on a `universal seesaw' mechanism and is compatible with tri-bi-maximal
mixing.
