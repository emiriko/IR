The essay presents Special Relativity (SR) from historical and conceptual
points of view. It also touches on some attempts to go beyond SR. However,
still more than 100 years old SR seems as vigorous as ever and no serious
challenger for a better local theory of spacetime is in sight yet. This
preliminary version of the essay is mainly in Scandinavian. Dictionary: rum =
space; tid = time.
