Due to its length and several inaccuracies, this article is no longer
suggested for reading. Moreover, in the meantime certain results presented
herein could be improved by the author in a non-trivial fashion.
  Instead, the reader is referred to the following two articles:
  The extrinsic holonomy Lie algebra of a parallel submanifold
(arXiv:0904.2611),
  Extrinsic homogeneity of parallel submanifolds (arXiv:0904.2636).
