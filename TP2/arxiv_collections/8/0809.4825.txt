Spin fluctuations (SF) and SF-mediated superconductivity (SC) in
quasi-two-dimensional metals around the antiferrromagnetic (AF) quantum
critical point (QCP) are investigated by using the self-consistent
renormalization theory for SF and the strong coupling theory for SC. We
introduce a parameter y0 as a measure for the distance from the AFQCP which is
approximately proportional to (x-xc), x being the electron (e) or hole (h)
doping concentration to the half-filled band and xc being the value at the
AFQCP. We present phase diagrams in the T-y0 plane including contour maps of
the AF correlation length and AF and SC transition temperatures TN and Tc,
respectively. The Tc curve is dome-shaped with a maximum at around the AFQCP.
The calculated one-electron spectral density shows a pseudogap in the
high-density-of-states region near (pi,0) below around a certain temperature T*
and gives a contour map at the Fermi energy reminiscent of the Fermi arc. These
results are discussed in comparison with e- and h-doped high-Tc cuprates.
