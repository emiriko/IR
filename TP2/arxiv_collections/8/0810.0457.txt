Our environment includes many factors, and each person on the Earth is
permanently influenced by two of them: weather and magnetic field. It was found
in the works of many investigators that the weather changes correlate with
human health state. In the same time, disturbances of geomagnetic field (as one
of the space weather manifestations) may influence bioobjects, including
people. In this work we demonstrate the cumulative effect of different external
factors (space weather and meteorological weather parameters) on human health
on the base of medical experimental data (blood pressure and heart rate data
rows for 86 people). It is shown that inclusion both solar-geomagnetic and
weather parameters in simulation process give adjusting mixed parameter, which
correlates with health state significantly better, than separated environmental
parameters do.
