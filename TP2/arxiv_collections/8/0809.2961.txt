Molecular bonds can be divided into four primary types: ionic, covalent, van
der Waals and hydrogen bonds. At ultralow temperatures a novel binding type
emerges paving the way for novel molecules and ultracold chemistry [1,2]. The
underlying mechanism for this new type of chemical bond is low-energy electron
scattering of Rydberg electrons from polarisable ground state atoms [3]. This
quantum scattering process can generate an attractive potential that is able to
bind the ground state atom to the Rydberg atom at a well localized position
within the Rydberg electron wave function. The resulting giant molecules can
have an internuclear separation of several thousand Bohr radii, which places
them among the largest known molecules to date. Their binding energies are much
smaller than the Kepler frequencies of the Rydberg electrons i.e. the atomic
Rydberg electron state is essentially unchanged by the bound ground state atom.
Ultracold and dense samples of atoms enable the creation of these molecules via
Rydberg excitation. In this paper we present spectroscopic evidence for the
vibrational ground and first excited state of a Rubidium dimer Rb(5S)-Rb(nS).
We apply a Born-Oppenheimer model to explain the measured binding energies for
principal quantum numbers n between 34 and 40 and extract the s-wave scattering
length for electron-Rb(5S) scattering in the relevant low energy regime Ekin <
100 meV. We also determine the lifetimes and the polarisabilities of these
molecules. P-wave bound states [2], Trimer states [4] as well as bound states
for large angular momentum of the Rydberg electron - socalled trilobite
molecules [1] - are within reach in the near future and will further refine our
conceptual understanding of the chemical bond.
