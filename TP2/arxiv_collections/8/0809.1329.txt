The fermion spin-flip conversion $f_L \to f_R + \gamma$ is considered, caused
by the difference of the additional energies of the electroweak origin,
acquired by left- and right-handed fermions (neutrino, electron) in medium. An
accurate taking account of the fermion and photon dispersion in medium is shown
to be important.
