The CMS detector at the LHC is in the final stages of preparation. The high
resolution Electromagnetic Calorimeter, which consists of nearly 76000 lead
tungstate crystals, will play a crucial role in the coming physics searches
undertaken by CMS. The design, status, and initial performance of the
calorimeter, in test beams and with cosmic rays, will be reviewed.
