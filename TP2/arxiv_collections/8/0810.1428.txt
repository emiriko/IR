In this paper we present an analytic study of sampled networks in the case of
some important shortest-path sampling models. We present analytic formulas for
the probability of edge discovery in the case of an evolving and a static
network model. We also show that the number of discovered edges in a finite
network scales much slower than predicted by earlier mean field models.
Finally, we calculate the degree distribution of sampled networks, and we
demonstrate that they are analogous to a destructed network obtained by
randomly removing edges from the original network.
