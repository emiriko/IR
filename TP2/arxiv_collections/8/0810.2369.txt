In this paper the author studies the singular limit c to infinity of the
family of Euler-Nordstr\"om systems indexed by the parameters kappa and c
(EN_kappa,c), where kappa^2 > 0 is the cosmological constant and c is the speed
of light. Using Christodoulou's techniques to generate energy currents, the
author develops Sobolev estimates that show that for initial data belonging to
an appropriate Sobolev space, as c tends to infinity, the solutions to the
EN_kappa,c system converge uniformly on a spacetime slab [0,T]xR^3 to the
solution of the Euler-Poisson system with the cosmological constant kappa^2.
