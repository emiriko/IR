The behavior of a family of mean-field glass models is reviewed. The models
are analyzed by means of a Langevin-based approach to the dynamics and a
Replica theory computation of the thermodynamics. We focus on the phase diagram
of a particular model case, where glass-to-glass transitions occur between
phases with a different number of characteristic time-scales for the relaxation
processes. The appearence of Johari-Goldstein processes as collective
reorganizations of sets of fast processes is discussed.
