It is well known that Raman scattering and fluorescence can be enhanced by
the presence of metallic nanoparticles. Here, we derive simple equations to
analyse the influence of metallic nanoparticles on upconversion processes such
as non-radiative energy transfer or excited state absorption. We compare the
resulting expressions with the more familiar Raman and fluorescence cases, and
find significant differences. We use numerical simulations to calculate the
upconverted signal enhancement achievable by means of metallic spheres of
different radii, and find particles of 100-400nm radius at infrared frequencies
to be favorable. We also discuss the considerable challenges involved in using
metallic particles to enhance upconversion for solar energy.
