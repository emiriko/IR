The interaction of C atoms with a screw and an edge dislocation is modelled
at an atomic scale using an empirical Fe-C interatomic potential based on the
Embedded Atom Method (EAM) and molecular statics simulations. Results of atomic
simulations are compared with predictions of elasticity theory. It is shown
that a quantitative agreement can be obtained between both modelling techniques
as long as anisotropic elastic calculations are performed and both the
dilatation and the tetragonal distortion induced by the C interstitial are
considered. Using isotropic elasticity allows to predict the main trends of the
interaction and considering only the interstitial dilatation will lead to a
wrong interaction.
