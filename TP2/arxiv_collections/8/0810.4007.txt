We investigate the Hubbard model on two typical frustrated lattices in two
dimensions, the kagome lattice and the anisotropic triangular lattice, by means
of the cellular dynamical mean field theory. We show that the metallic phase is
stabilized up to fairly large Hubbard interactions under strong geometrical
frustration in both cases, which results in heavy fermion behavior and several
anomalous properties around the Mott transition point. In particular, for the
anisotropic triangular lattice, we find novel reentrant behavior in the Mott
transition in the moderately frustrated parameter regime, which is caused by
the competition between Fermi-liquid formation and magnetic correlations. It is
demonstrated that the reentrant behavior is a generic feature inherent in the
Mott transition with intermediate geometrical frustration, and indeed in
accordance with recent experimental findings for organic materials.
