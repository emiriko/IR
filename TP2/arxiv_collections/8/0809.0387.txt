In psychophysical experiments time and the limited goodwill of participants
is usually a major constraint. This has been the main motivation behind the
early development of adaptive methods for the measurements of psychometric
thresholds. More recently methods have been developed to measure whole
psychometric functions in an adaptive way. Here we describe a Bayesian method
to measure adaptively any aspect of a psychophysical function, taking
inspiration from Kontsevich and Tyler's optimal Bayesian measurement method.
Our method is implemented in a complete and easy-to-use MATLAB package.
