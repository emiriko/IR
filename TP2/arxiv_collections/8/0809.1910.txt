In this paper, a generalization of the traditional point-to-point to
communication setup, which is named as "reliable communications with asymmetric
codebooks", is proposed. Under the assumption of independent identically
distributed (i.i.d) encoder codewords, it is proven that the operational
capacity of the system is equal to the information capacity of the system,
which is given by $\max_{p(x)} I(U;Y)$, where $X, U$ and $Y$ denote the
individual random elements of encoder codewords, decoder codewords and decoder
inputs. The capacity result is derived in the "binary symmetric" case (which is
an analogous formulation of the traditional "binary symmetric channel" for our
case), as a function of the system parameters. A conceptually insightful
inference is made by attributing the difference from the classical Shannon-type
capacity of binary symmetric channel to the {\em gap} due to the codebook
asymmetry.
