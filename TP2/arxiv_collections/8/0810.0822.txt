In this work, we present a deformed solutions starting from systems of three
coupled scalar fields with super-potential $W(\phi_1, \phi_2, \phi_3)$ by orbit
method. First, we deform the corresponding super-potential and obtain defect
solutions. It is shown that how to construct new models altogether with its
defect solutions in terms of the non-deformed model. Therefore, we draw the
graph of super-potential and different fields in terms of $x.$ So we observe
that the graphs for deformed and non - deformed cases are changed by the scale.
