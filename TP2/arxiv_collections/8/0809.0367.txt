The dynamics of charge particles described by Gaussian wave packet in
monolayer graphene is studied analytically and numerically. We demonstrate that
the shape of wave packet at arbitrary time depends on correlation between the
initial electron amplitudes $\psi_1(\vec r,0)$ and $\psi_2(\vec r,0)$ on the
sublattices $A$ and $B$ correspondingly (i.e. pseudospin polarization). For the
transverse pseudospin polarization the motion of the center of wave packet
occurs in the direction perpendicular to the average momentum $ {\vec
p_0}=\hbar \vec{k_0}$. Moreover, in this case the initial wave packet splits
into two parts moving with opposite velocities along $ {\vec p_0}$. If the
initial direction of pseudospin coincides with average momentum the splitting
is absent and the center of wave packet is displaced at $t>0$ along the same
direction. The results of our calculations show that all types of motion
experience {\it zitterbewegung}. Besides, depending on initial polarization the
velocity of the packet center may have the constant component $v_c=uf(a)$,
where $u\approx 10^8 cm/s$ is the Fermi velocity and $f(a)$ is a function of
the parameter $a=k_0d$ ($d$ is the initial width of wave packet). As a result,
the direction of the packet motion is determined not only by the orientation of
the average momentum, but mainly by the phase difference between the up- and
low- components of the wave functions. Similar peculiarities of the dynamics of
2D electron wave packet connected with initial spin polarization should take
place in the semiconductor quantum well under the influence of the Rashba
spin-orbit coupling.
