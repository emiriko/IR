To analyze the stability of It\^o stochastic differential equations with
multiplicative noise, we introduce the stochastic logarithmic norm. The
logarithmic norm was originally introduced by G. Dahlquist in 1958 as a tool to
study the growth of solutions to ordinary differential equations and for
estimating the error growth in discretization methods for their approximate
solutions. We extend the concept to the stability analysis of It\^o stochastic
differential equations with multiplicative noise. Stability estimates for
linear It\^o SDEs using the one, two and $\infty$-norms in the $l$-th mean,
where $1 \leq l < \infty $, are derived and the application of the stochastic
logarithmic norm is illustrated with examples.
