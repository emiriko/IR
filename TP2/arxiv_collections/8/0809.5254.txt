The spectrum of meson and diquark excitations of the color--flavor locked
(CFL) phase of dense quark matter is considered in the framework of the Nambu
-- Jona-Lasinio model. We have found that in this phase all Nambu--Goldstone
bosons are realized as scalar and pseudoscalar diquarks. Other diquark
excitations are resonances with mass value around 230 MeV. Mesons are stable
particles in the CFL phase. Their masses vs chemical potential lie in the
interval 300$\div$500 MeV.
