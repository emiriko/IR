We study the quark number susceptibility, an indicator of QCD phase
transition, in the hard wall and soft wall models of hQCD. We find that the
susceptibilities in both models are the same, jumping up at the deconfinement
phase transition temperature. We also find that the diffusion constant in the
soft wall model is enhanced compared to the one in the hard wall model.
