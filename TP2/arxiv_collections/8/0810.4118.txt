We study a process of opinion formation in a population of agents whose
interaction pattern is defined on the basis of randomly distributed groups of
three agents, or triplets -in contrast to networks, which are defined on the
basis of agent pairs. Results for the time needed to reach full consensus are
compared between a triplet-based structure with a given number of triplets and
a random network with the same number of triangles. The full-consensus time in
the triplet structure is systematically lower than in the network. This
discrepancy can be ascribed to differences in the shape of the probability
distribution for the number of triplets and triangles per agent in each
interaction pattern.
