Closed string tachyon emission from a traveling long string in Liouville
string theory is studied. The exact collective field Hamiltonian in the adjoint
sector of the c=1 matrix model is computed to capture the interaction between
the tip of the long string and the closed string tachyon field. The amplitude
for emission of a single tachyon quantum is obtained in a closed form using the
chiral formalism.
