Ultra-cold clouds of dimeric molecules can dissociate into quantum
mechanically correlated constituent atoms that are either bosons or fermions.
We theoretically model the dissociation of cigar shaped molecular condensates,
for which this difference manifests as complementary geometric structures of
the dissociated atoms. For atomic bosons beams form along the long axis of the
molecular condensate. For atomic fermions beams form along the short axis. This
directional beaming simplifies the measurement of correlations between the
atoms through relative number squeezing.
