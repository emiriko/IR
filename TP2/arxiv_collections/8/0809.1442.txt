The analog of the Cachazo-Svrvcek-Witten rules for scattering amplitudes with
massive quarks is derived following an approach previously employed for
amplitudes with massive scalars. A prescription for the external wave-functions
is given that leads to a one-to one relation between fields in the action and
spin-states of massive quarks. Several examples for the application of the
rules are given and the structure of some all-multiplicity amplitudes with a
pair of massive quarks is discussed. The rules make supersymmetric relations to
amplitudes with massive scalars manifest at the level of the action. The
formalism is extended to several quark flavors with different masses.
