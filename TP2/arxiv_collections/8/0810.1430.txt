We consider the design of cognitive Medium Access Control (MAC) protocols
enabling an unlicensed (secondary) transmitter-receiver pair to communicate
over the idle periods of a set of licensed channels, i.e., the primary network.
The objective is to maximize data throughput while maintaining the
synchronization between secondary users and avoiding interference with licensed
(primary) users. No statistical information about the primary traffic is
assumed to be available a-priori to the secondary user. We investigate two
distinct sensing scenarios. In the first, the secondary transmitter is capable
of sensing all the primary channels, whereas it senses one channel only in the
second scenario. In both cases, we propose MAC protocols that efficiently learn
the statistics of the primary traffic online. Our simulation results
demonstrate that the proposed blind protocols asymptotically achieve the
throughput obtained when prior knowledge of primary traffic statistics is
available.
