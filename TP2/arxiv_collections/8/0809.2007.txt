The motto of this paper is: Let's face Bose-Einstein condensation through
nonlinear dynamics. We do this by choosing variational forms of the condensate
wave functions (of given symmetry classes), which convert the Bose-Einstein
condensates via the time-dependent Gross-Pitaevskii equation into Hamiltonian
systems that can be studied using the methods of nonlinear dynamics. We
consider in particular cold quantum gases where long-range interactions between
the neutral atoms are present, in addition to the conventional short-range
contact interaction, viz. gravity-like interactions, and dipole-dipole
interactions. The results obtained serve as a useful guide in the search for
nonlinear dynamics effects in numerically exact quantum calculations for
Bose-Einstein condensates. A main result is the prediction of the existence of
stable islands as well as chaotic regions for excited states of dipolar
condensates, which could be checked experimentally.
