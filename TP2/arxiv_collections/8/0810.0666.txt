The purpose of this note is to point out ambiguities that appear in the
calculation of angular momentum and its radiated counterpart when some simple
formulae are used to compute them. We illustrate, in two simple different
examples, how incorrect results can be obtained with them. Additionally, we
discuss the magnitude of possible errors in well known situations.
