A universal linear-temperature dependence of the uniform magnetic
susceptibility has been observed in the nonmagnetic normal state of
iron-pnictides. This non-Pauli and non-Curie-Weiss-like paramagnetic behavior
cannot be understood within a pure itinerant picture. We argue that it results
from the existence of a wide antiferromagnetic fluctuation window in which the
local spin-density-wave correlations exist but the global directional order has
not been established yet.
