Hadron dynamics is formulated in terms of interacting composite strings.
Consistent composite string model with extended Virasoro superconformal
symmetry is found. These composite strings carry flavour and chiral degrees of
freedom on edging two-dimensional surfaces. Necessary correct description of
string amplitudes without states of negative norms in the spectrum of physical
states is reached when special supercurrents conditions are fulfilled.
