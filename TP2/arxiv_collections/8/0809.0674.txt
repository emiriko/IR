The drift and diffusion of a cloud of ions in a fluid are distorted by an
inhomogeneous electric field. If the electric field carries the center of the
distribution in a straight line and the field configuration is suitably
symmetric, the distortion can be calculated analytically. We examine the
specific examples of fields with cylindrical and spherical symmetry in detail
assuming the ion distributions to be of a generally Gaussian form. The effects
of differing diffusion coefficients in the transverse and longitudinal
directions are included.
