In this paper, we are interested in the limit theorem question for sums of
indicator functions. We show that in every aperiodic dynamical system, for
every increasing sequence $(a_n)_{n\in\N}\subset\R_+$ such that
$a_n\nearrow\infty$ and $\frac{a_n}{n}\to 0$ as $n\to\infty$, there exists a
measurable set $A$ such that the sequence of the distributions of the partial
sums $\frac{1}{a_n}\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}(\ind_A-\mu(A))\circ T^i$ is dense in the
set of the probability measures on $\R$. Further, in the ergodic case, we prove
that there exists a dense $G_\delta$ of such sets.
