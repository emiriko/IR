A new model is proposed, in the context of Axelrod's model for the study of
cultural dissemination, to include and external vector field (VF) which
describes the effects of mass media on social systems. The VF acts over the
whole system and it is characterized by two parameters: a non-null overlap with
each agent in the society and a confidence value of its information. Beyond a
threshold value of the confidence there is induced monocultural globalization
of the system lined up with the VF. Below this value, the multicultural states
are unstable and certain homogenization of the system is obtained in opposite
line up according to that we have called {\it negative publicity} effect. Three
regimes of behavior for the spread process of the VF information as a function
of time are reported.
