We correct the mistaken claim made in \cite{Guzey:2005ec,Guzey:2006xi} that
the minimal model of the dual parameterization of nucleon generalized parton
distributions (GPDs) gives a good, essentially model-independent description of
high-energy data on deeply virtual Compton scattering (DVCS). In the
implementation of the dual parameterization in
\cite{Guzey:2005ec,Guzey:2006xi}, the numerical prefactor of two in front of
the DVCS amplitude was missing. We show that the corrected minimal model of the
dual parameterization significantly overestimates the HERA data (H1 and ZEUS)
on the DVCS cross section.
