We present a theoretical investigation of a lattice Tonks-gas that is created
by inelastic, instead of elastic interactions. An analytical calculation shows
that in the limit of strong two-body losses, the dynamics of the system is
effectively that of a Tonks gas. We also derive an analytic expression for the
effective loss rate. We find good agreement between these analytical results
and results from a rigorous numerical calculation. The Tonks character of the
gas is visible both in a reduced effective loss rate and in the momentum
distribution of the gas.
