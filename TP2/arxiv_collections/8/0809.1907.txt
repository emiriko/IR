We discuss an alternative formulation of the problem of quantum optical
fields in a curved space-time using localized operators. We contrast the new
formulation with the standard approach and find observable differences for
entangled states. We propose an experiment in which an entangled pair of
optical pulses are propagated through non-uniform gravitational fields and find
that the new formulation predicts de-correlation of the optical entanglement
under experimentally realistic conditions.
