We calculate the excitation spectra of a spin-polarized Hubbard chain away
from half-filling, using a high-precision momentum-resolved time-dependent
Density Matrix Renormalization Group method. Focusing on the U<0 case, we
present in some detail the single-fermion, pair, density and spin spectra, and
discuss how spin-charge separation is altered for this system. The pair spectra
show a quasi-condensate at a nonzero momentum proportional to the polarization,
as expected for this Fulde-Ferrel-Larkin-Ovchinnikov-like superfluid.
