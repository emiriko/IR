We define a normalized impact factor suitable to assess in a simple way both
the strength of scientific communities and the research influence of
individuals. We define those ones with $NIF \geq 1$ as being scientific leaders
since they would influence their peers at least as much as they are influenced
by them. The NIF is distinguished because (a) this has a clear and universal
meaning being applicable with equal efficiency to individuals belonging to
scientific communities with quite different publication and citation traditions
and (b) this is robust against self-citation expedient. This is eventually
applied to a community derived from the list of outstanding referees recognized
by the American Physical Society in 2008.
