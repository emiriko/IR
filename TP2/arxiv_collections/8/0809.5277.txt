The usual transformations of the three-dimensional (3D) fields E and B that
are found in [1] ([1] A. Einstein, Ann. Physik \17, 891 (1905)) are always
considered to be the relativistically correct Lorentz transformations (LT) of E
and B. However, as proved in, e.g., [2] ([2] T. Ivezi\'c, Found. Phys. Lett.
18, 301 (2005)), these transformations drastically differ from the LT of the
relativistically correct 4D electric and magnetic fields. In this paper a
simple proof of that difference will be presented and the consequences for EDM
experiments and for some quantum phase shifts experiments are briefly examined.
In all such experiments the usual 3D quantities, e.g., E, B, ... are measured
and their relativistically incorrect transformations are used, but not the
relativistically correct 4D geometric quantities, e.g., E^a, B^a, ... and their
LT.
