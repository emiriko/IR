We propose a potentially practical scheme, in combination with the Bell-state
analyzer [Zhang et al., Phys. Rev. A 73, 014301 (2006)], to generate Bell
states for two electron spins confined, respectively, in two distant
fullerenes. To this end, we consider the endohedral fullerenes staying in
single walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) and employ auxiliary mobile electrons
and selective microwave pulses. The application and the experimental
feasibility of our scheme are discussed.
