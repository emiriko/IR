Coalitional voting games appear in different forms in multi-agent systems,
social choice and threshold logic. In this paper, the complexity of comparison
of influence between players in coalitional voting games is characterized. The
possible representations of simple games considered are simple games
represented by winning coalitions, minimal winning coalitions, weighted voting
game or a multiple weighted voting game. The influence of players is gauged
from the viewpoint of basic player types, desirability relations and classical
power indices such as Shapley-Shubik index, Banzhaf index, Holler index,
Deegan-Packel index and Chow parameters. Among other results, it is shown that
for a simple game represented by minimal winning coalitions, although it is
easy to verify whether a player has zero or one voting power, computing the
Banzhaf value of the player is #P-complete. Moreover, it is proved that
multiple weighted voting games are the only representations for which it is
NP-hard to verify whether the game is linear or not. For a simple game with a
set W^m of minimal winning coalitions and n players, a O(n.|W^m|+(n^2)log(n))
algorithm is presented which returns `no' if the game is non-linear and returns
the strict desirability ordering otherwise. The complexity of transforming
simple games into compact representations is also examined.
