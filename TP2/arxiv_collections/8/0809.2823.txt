An updated measurement of alpha_s(m_tau) from ALEPH tau hadronic spectral
functions is presented. We report a study of the perturbative prediction(s)
showing that the fixed-order perturbation theory manifests convergence or
principle problems not presented in the contour-improved calculation. Potential
systematic effects from quark-hadron duality violations are estimated to be
within the quoted systematic errors. The fit result is alpha_s(m_tau) = 0.344
+- 0.005 +- 0.007, where the first error is experimental and the second
theoretical. After evolution, the alpha_s(M_Z) determined from tau data is one
of the most precise to date, in agreement with the corresponding NNNLO value
derived from Z decays.
