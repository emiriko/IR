Elastic scattering resonances occurring in ultracold collisions of either
bosonic or fermionic polar molecules are investigated. The Born-Oppenheimer
adiabatic representation of the two-bodydynamics provides both a qualitative
classification scheme and a quantitative WKB quantization condition that
predicts several sequences of resonant states. It is found that the
near-threshold energy dependence of ultracold collision cross sections varies
significantly with the particle exchange symmetry, with bosonic systems showing
much smoother energy variations than their fermionic counterparts. Resonant
variations of the angular distributions in ultracold collisions are also
described.
