We formulate a generalized mean-field theory of a mixture of fermionic and
bosonic atoms, in which the fermion-boson interaction can be controlled by a
Feshbach resonance. The theory correctly accounts for molecular binding
energies of the molecules in the two-body limit, in contrast to the most
straightforward mean-field theory. Using this theory, we discuss the
equilibrium properties of fermionic molecules created from atom pairs in the
gas. We also address the formation of molecules when the magnetic field is
ramped across the resonance, and present a simple Landau-Zener result for this
process.
