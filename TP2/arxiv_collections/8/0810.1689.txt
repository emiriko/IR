In this work a mu=-1 metamaterial (MM) lens for magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) is demonstrated. MRI uses surface coils to detect the radiofrequency(RF)
energy absorbed and emitted by the nuclear spins in the imaged object. The
proposed MM lens manipulates the RF field detected by these surface coils, so
that the coil sensitivity and spatial localization is substantially improved.
Beyond this specific application, we feel that the reported results are the
experimental confirmation of a new concept for the manipulation of RF field in
MRI, which paves the way to many other interesting applications.
