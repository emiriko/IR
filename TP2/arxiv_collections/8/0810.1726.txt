A general quantum noisy channel is analyzed, wherein the transmitted qubits
may experience symmetry-breaking decoherence, along with memory effects. We
find the optimal basis not to be fully entangled, but a combination of
factorized and partially-entangled states in the presence of memory, asymmetry
and the state-bias of the noise. Capacity-maximization is shown to be
achievable by combining temporal shaping of the transmitted qubits and optimal
basis selection.
