We classify all proper-biharmonic Legendre curves in a Sasakian space form
and point out some of their geometric properties. Then we provide a method for
constructing anti-invariant proper-biharmonic submanifolds in Sasakian space
forms. Finally, using the Boothby-Wang fibration, we determine all
proper-biharmonic Hopf cylinders over homogeneous real hypersurfaces in complex
projective spaces.
