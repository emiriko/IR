A positive definite even Hermitian lattice is called \emph{even universal} if
it represents all even positive integers. We introduce a method to get all even
universal binary Hermitian lattices over imaginary quadratic fields $\Q{-m}$
for all positive square-free integers $m$ and we list optimal criterions on
even universality of Hermitian lattices over $\Q{-m}$ which admits even
universal binary Hermitian lattices.
