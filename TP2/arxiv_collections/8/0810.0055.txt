Most previous contributions to BSDEs, and the related theories of nonlinear
expectation and dynamic risk measures, have been in the framework of continuous
time diffusions or jump diffusions. Using solutions of BSDEs on spaces related
to finite state, continuous time Markov chains, we develop a theory of
nonlinear expectations in the spirit of [Dynamically consistent nonlinear
evaluations and expectations (2005) Shandong Univ.]. We prove basic properties
of these expectations and show their applications to dynamic risk measures on
such spaces. In particular, we prove comparison theorems for scalar and vector
valued solutions to BSDEs, and discuss arbitrage and risk measures in the
scalar case.
