In supersymmetric generalizations of the Standard Model, all stable Q-balls
are associated with some flat directions. We show that, if the flat direction
has both the baryon number and the lepton number, the scalar field inside the
Q-ball can deviate slightly from the flat direction in the ground state. We
identify the true ground states of such nontopological solitons, including the
electrically neutral and electrically charged Q-balls.
