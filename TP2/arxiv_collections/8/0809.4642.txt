Although most networks in nature exhibit complex topology the origins of such
complexity remains unclear. We introduce a model of a growing network of
interacting agents in which each new agent's membership to the network is
determined by the agent's effect on the network's global stability. It is shown
that out of this stability constraint, scale free networks emerges in a self
organized manner, offering an explanation for the ubiquity of complex
topological properties observed in biological networks.
