We present a genetic algorithm for the atomistic design and global
optimisation of substitutionally disordered bulk materials and surfaces.
Premature convergence which hamper conventional genetic algorithms due to
problems with synchronisation is avoided using a symmetry adapted crossover.
The algorithm outperforms previously reported Monte Carlo and genetic algorithm
simulations for finding low energy minima of two simple alloy models without
the need for any redesign.
