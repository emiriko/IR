We discuss effects of the stepping kinetics of molecular motors on their
traffic behavior on crowded filaments using a simple two-state chemomechanical
cycle. While the general traffic behavior is quite robust with respect to the
detailed kinetics of the step, a few observable parameters exhibit a strong
dependence on these parameters. Most strikingly, the effective unbinding rate
of the motors may both increase and decrease with increasing traffic density,
depending on the details of the motor step. Likewise the run length either
exhibits a strong decrease or almost no dependence on the traffic density. We
compare our theoretical results with recent experimental observations on motor
traffic.
