We analyse the effect of the non-minimal coupling of the form $\xi\phi^2R/2$
on the single field inflation. If the non-minimal coupling is large, it relaxes
the constraint on the field self coupling, making it possible to use the
Standard Model Higgs field as the inflaton. At the same time, even small
non-minimal coupling constant, $\xi\gtrsim10^{-3}$, brings the usual inflaton
with quartic potential in agreement with the WMAP5 observations.
