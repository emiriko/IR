We study thermodynamic properties and the electrical conductivity of dense
hydrogen and deuterium using three methods: classical reactive Monte Carlo
(REMC), direct path integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) and a quantum dynamics method
in the Wigner representation of quantum mechanics. We report the calculation of
the deuterium compression quasi-isentrope in good agreement with experiments.
We also solve the Wigner-Liouville equation of dense degenerate hydrogen
calculating the initial equilibrium state by the PIMC method. The obtained
particle trajectories determine the momentum-momentum correlation functions and
the electrical conductivity and are compared with available theories and
simulations.
