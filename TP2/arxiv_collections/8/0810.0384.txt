The transmission of vector infectious diseases, which produces complex
spatiotemporal patterns, is analyzed by a periodically forced two-dimensional
cellular automata model. The system, which comprises three population levels,
is introduced to describe complex features of the dynamics of the vector
transmitted dengue epidemics, known to be very sensitive to seasonal variables.
The three coupled levels represent the human, the adult and immature vector
populations. The dynamics includes external seasonality forcing (rainfall
intensity data), human and mosquito mobility, and vector control effects. The
model parameters, even if bounded to well defined intervals obtained from
reported data, can be selected to reproduce specific epidemic outbursts. In the
current study, explicit results are obtained by comparison with actual data
retrieved from the time-series of dengue epidemics in two cities in Brazil. The
results show fluctuations that are not captured by mean-field models. It also
reveals the qualitative behavior of the spatiotemporal patterns of the
epidemics. In the extreme situation of absence of external periodic drive, the
model predicts completely distinct long time evolution. The model is robust in
the sense that it is able to reproduce the time series of dengue epidemics of
different cities, provided the forcing term takes into account the local
rainfall modulation. Finally, the dependence between epidemics threshold and
vector control undergoes a transition from power law to stretched exponential
behavior due to human mobility effect.
