Quantum theory (QT) provides statistical predictions for various physical
phenomena. The outcomes of these measurements are in general some numerical
time series registered by some macroscopic instruments. The various empirical
probability distributions extracted from these time series were shown to be
consistent with the probabilistic predictions of QT. However it was not proven
that the time series of existing experimental data did not contain some
stochastic fine structures, which could have been averaged out by describing
them in terms of the empirical probability distributions. In this paper we
advocate various statistical tests which could be used to search for such fine
structures in the data and to answer the title question of this paper. In our
opinion a proper understanding of the statistical character of QT and of its
limitations is crucial in the domains such as: quantum optics and quantum
information.
