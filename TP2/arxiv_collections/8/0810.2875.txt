We study the nature of the new charm and charmonium like states observed in
the last few years, using a constituent quark model with an screened
confinement potential. In the open charm sector we discuss different options
for the $D_{sJ}(2860)$ including tetraquark configurations. In the hidden charm
sector the new Y(4360) and Y(4660) are interpreted as $1^{--}$ states. The
influence in the puzzling 3940 MeV region of multiquark configuration is
discussed.
