This fluid dynamics video presents experiments and simulations of
gravity-driven particulate jets in viscous fluids at low Reynolds number. An
initially straight jet is shown to develop varicose modulations of its diameter
as it sediments under the action of gravity. While this instability is
qualitatively reminiscent of the classical Rayleigh-Plateau instability for
immiscible fluids, its mechanism has yet to be understood as neither inertia
nor surface tension play a role in the case of a dilute suspension at Re=0.
