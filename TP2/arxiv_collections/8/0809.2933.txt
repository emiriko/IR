We calculate the inclusive J/Psi production in heavy ion collisions including
the effects of gluon saturation in the wave functions of the colliding nuclei.
We argue that the dominant production mechanism in proton--nucleus and
nucleus--nucleus collisions for heavy nuclei is different from the one in
hadron-hadron interactions. We find that the rapidity distribution of primary
J/Psi production is more peaked around midrapidity than the analogous
distribution in elementary pp collisions. We discuss the consequences of this
fact on the experimentally observed J/Psi suppression in Au-Au collisions at
RHIC energies.
