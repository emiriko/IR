Temperature increase in saturated porous materials under undrained conditions
leads to thermal pressurization of the pore fluid due to the discrepancy
between the thermal expansion coefficients of the pore fluid and of the solid
matrix. This increase in the pore fluid pressure induces a reduction of the
effective mean stress and can lead to shear failure or hydraulic fracturing.
The equations governing the phenomenon of thermal pressurization are presented
and this phenomenon is studied experimentally for a saturated granular rock in
an undrained heating test under constant isotropic stress. Careful analysis of
the effect of mechanical and thermal deformation of the drainage and pressure
measurement system is performed and a correction of the measured pore pressure
is introduced. The test results are modelled using a non-linear
thermo-poro-elastic constitutive model of the granular rock with emphasis on
the stress-dependent character of the rock compressibility. The effects of
stress and temperature on thermal pressurization observed in the tests are
correctly reproduced by the model.
