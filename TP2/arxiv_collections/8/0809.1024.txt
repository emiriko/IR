Overdispersed count data are modelled with likelihood and non-likelihood
approaches. Likelihood approaches include the Poisson mixtures with three
distributions, the gamma, the lognormal, and the inverse Gaussian
distributions. Non-likelihood approaches include the robust sandwich estimator
and quasilikelihood. In this simulation study, overdispersed count data were
simulated under the Poisson mixtures with the gamma, the lognormal and the
inverse Gaussian distributions, then analyzed with the five likelihood and
non-likelihood approaches. Our results indicated that 1) when the count data
are mildly overdispersed, there are virtually no differences in type I error
rate, standard error of the main effect, and empirical power among the five
methods; 2) when the count data are very overdispersed, none of these five
approaches is robust to model misspecification as evaluated by type I error
rate, standard error of the main effect, and empirical power. This simulation
study raises caution on using non-likelihood method for analyzing very
overdispered count data because of likely higher type I error and inappropriate
power levels. Unlike non-likelihood approaches, likelihood approaches allow for
statistical tests based on likelihood ratios and for checking model fit and
provide basis for power and sample size calculations. When likelihood
approaches are used, we suggest comparing likelihood values to select the
appropriate parametric method for analyzing very overdispersed count data.
