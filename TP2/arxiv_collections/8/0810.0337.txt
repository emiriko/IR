Assuming a classical statistical system of point particles the fundamental
equations of continuum thermomechanics (continuity equation, equation of
motion, and energy equation) shall be derived exactly. The macroscopic state
functions (density, velocity, stress, energy density, heat flux) are
interpreted as expected values.
