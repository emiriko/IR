We analyze nonlinear coupling between individual vibrational quanta for
trapped ions. The nonlinear Coulomb interaction causes a Kerr-type Hamiltonian,
for which we derive an analytical expression for the coupling constant. In
contrast to a previously published formula [1], our result is in close
agreement with experimental data.
