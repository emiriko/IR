One-dimensional steady-state plasma-field structures in overdense plasma are
studied assuming that the electron temperature is uniform over plasma bulk and
the ions are stationary. It is shown that there may exist solutions for
electron distributions with cavitation regions in plasma under the action of
ponderomotive force
