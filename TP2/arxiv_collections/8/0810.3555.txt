Looking towards first LHC collisions, the ATLAS detector is being
commissioned using the physics data available: cosmic rays and data taken
during the LHC single beam operations at 450 GeV. During the installation of
the ATLAS detector in the cavern, cosmic rays were collected with the different
parts of the detector that were available. Combined cosmic runs taken with the
full installed detector with and without magnetic field as well as a few single
beam events recently recorded are being used to commission the full system
prior to the first proton collisions.
