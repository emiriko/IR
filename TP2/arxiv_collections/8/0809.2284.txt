A search was made for sub-threshold $J/\psi$ production from a carbon target
using a mixed real and quasi-real Bremsstrahlung photon beam with an endpoint
energy of 5.76 GeV. No events were observed, which is consistent with
predictions assuming quasi-free production. The results place limits on exotic
mechanisms that strongly enhance quasi-free production.
