Nonlinear Zeeman (NLZ) shifts arising from magnetic-field mixing of the two
hyperfine ground-states in alkali atoms lead to splitting of magnetic-resonance
lines. This is a major source of sensitivity degradation and the so-called
"heading errors" of alkali-vapor atomic magnetometers operating in the
geophysical field range (B approx. 0.2-0.7 G). Here, it is shown theoretically
and experimentally that NLZ shifts can be effectively canceled by light shifts
caused by a laser field of appropriate intensity, polarization and frequency, a
technique that can be readily applied in practical situations.
