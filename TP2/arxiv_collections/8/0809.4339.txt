We present a formal connection between Lagrangian and Eulerian velocity
increment distributions which is applicable to a wide range of turbulent
systems ranging from turbulence in incompressible fluids to magnetohydrodynamic
turbulence. For the case of the inverse cascade regime of two-dimensional
turbulence we numerically estimate the transition probabilities involved in
this connection. In this context we are able to directly identify the processes
leading to strongly non-Gaussian statistics for the Lagrangian velocity
increments.
