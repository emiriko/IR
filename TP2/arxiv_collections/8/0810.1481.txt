Multi-relational networks are used extensively to structure knowledge.
Perhaps the most popular instance, due to the widespread adoption of the
Semantic Web, is the Resource Description Framework (RDF). One of the primary
purposes of a knowledge network is to reason; that is, to alter the topology of
the network according to an algorithm that uses the existing topological
structure as its input. There exist many such reasoning algorithms. With
respect to the Semantic Web, the bivalent, monotonic reasoners of the RDF
Schema (RDFS) and the Web Ontology Language (OWL) are the most prevalent.
However, nothing prevents other forms of reasoning from existing in the
Semantic Web. This article presents a non-bivalent, non-monotonic, evidential
logic and reasoner that is an algebraic ring over a multi-relational network
equipped with two binary operations that can be composed to execute various
forms of inference. Given its multi-relational grounding, it is possible to use
the presented evidential framework as another method for structuring knowledge
and reasoning in the Semantic Web. The benefits of this framework are that it
works with arbitrary, partial, and contradictory knowledge while, at the same
time, it supports a tractable approximate reasoning process.
