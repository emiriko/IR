In this work, we theoretically examine recent pump/probe photoemission
experiments on the strongly correlated charge-density-wave insulator TaS\_2. We
describe the general nonequilibrium many-body formulation of time-resolved
photoemission in the sudden approximation, and then solve the problem using
dynamical mean-field theory with the numerical renormalization group and a bare
density of states calculated from density functional theory including the
charge-density-wave distortion of the ion cores and spin-orbit coupling
  We find a number of interesting results: (i) the bare band structure actually
has more dispersion in the perpendicular direction than in the two-dimensional
planes; (ii) the DMFT approach can produce upper and lower Hubbard bands that
resemble those in the experiment, but the upper bands will overlap in energy
with other higher energy bands; (iii) the effect of the finite width of the
probe pulse is minimal on the shape of the photoemission spectra; and (iv) the
quasiequilibrium approximation does not fully describe the behavior in this
system.
