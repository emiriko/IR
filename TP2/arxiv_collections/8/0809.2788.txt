We consider the Higgs sector of multi-Higgs-doublet models in the presence of
simple symmetries relating the various fields. We construct basis invariant
observables which may in principle be used to detect these symmetries for any
number of doublets. A categorization of the symmetries into classes is
required, which we perform in detail for the case of two and three Higgs
doublets.
