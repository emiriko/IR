We investigate the propagation of information through one-dimensional quantum
chains in fluctuating external fields. We find that information propagation is
suppressed, but in a quite different way compared to the situation with static
disorder. We study two settings: (i) a general model where an unobservable
fluctuating field acts as a source of decoherence; (ii) the XX model with both
observable and unobservable fluctuating fields. In the first setting we
establish a noise threshold below which information can propagate ballistically
and above which information is localised. In the second setting we find
localisation for all levels of unobservable noise, whilst an observable field
can yield diffusive propagation of information.
