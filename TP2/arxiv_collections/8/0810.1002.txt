We present a review of the recent progress on percolation scaling limits in
two dimensions. In particular, we will consider the convergence of critical
crossing probabilities to Cardy's formula and of the critical exploration path
to chordal SLE(6), the full scaling limit of critical cluster boundaries, and
near-critical scaling limits.
