We present a program for the numerical evaluation of form factors entering
the calculation of one-loop amplitudes with up to six external legs. The
program is written in Fortran95 and performs the reduction to a certain set of
basis integrals numerically, using a formalism where inverse Gram determinants
can be avoided. It can be used to calculate one-loop amplitudes with massless
internal particles in a fast and numerically stable way.
