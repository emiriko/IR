The Josephson junction noise detector measures the skewness of non-Gaussian
noise via the asymmetry of the rate of escape from the zero-voltage state upon
reversal of the bias current. The feedback of this detector on the noise
generating device is investigated in detail. Concise predictions are made for a
second Josephson junction as noise generating device. The strong nonlinearity
of this component implies particularly strong feedback effects, including a
change of sign of the rate asymmetry as the applied voltage approaches twice
the superconducting gap.
