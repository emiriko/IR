We relate a construction of Kadeishvili's establishing an
A-infinity-structure on the homology of a differential graded algebra or more
generally of an A-infinity algebra with certain constructions of Chen and
Gugenheim. Thereafter we establish the links of these constructions with
subsequent developments.
