The M$\o$ller tetrad gravitational energy-momentum expression was recently
evaluated for a small vacuum region using orthonormal frames adapted to Riemann
normal coordinates. However the result was not proportional to the Bel-Robinson
tensor $B_{\alpha\beta\mu\nu}$. Treating a modified quasilocal expressions in a
similar way, we found one unique combination that gives a multiple of
$B_{\alpha\beta\mu\nu}$ which provides a non-negative gravitational
energy-momentum in the small sphere approximation. Moreover, in addition to
$B_{\alpha\beta\mu\nu}$, we found a certain tensor
$S_{\alpha\beta\mu\nu}+K_{\alpha\beta\mu\nu}$ which gives the same
"energy-momentum" density in vacuum. Using this tensor combination, we obtained
an infinite set of solutions that provides a positive gravitational energy
within the same limit.
