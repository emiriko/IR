We present the status of runs performed in the twisted mass formalism with
$N_{\rm f}=2+1+1$ flavours of dynamical fermions: a degenerate light doublet
and a mass split heavy doublet. The procedure for tuning to maximal twist will
be described as well as the current status of the runs using both thin and
stout links. Preliminary results for a few observables obtained on ensembles at
maximal twist will be given. Finally, a reweighting procedure to tune to
maximal twist will be described.
