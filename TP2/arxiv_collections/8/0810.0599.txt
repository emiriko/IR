The paper is concerned with approximating the distribution of a sum W of n
integer valued random variables Y_i, whose distributions depend on the state of
an underlying Markov chain X. The approximation is in terms of a translated
Poisson distribution, with mean and variance chosen to be close to those of W,
and the error is measured with respect to the total variation norm. Error
bounds comparable to those found for normal approximation with respect to the
weaker Kolmogorov distance are established, provided that the distribution of
the sum of the Y_i's between the successive visits of X to a reference state is
aperiodic. Without this assumption, approximation in total variation cannot be
expected to be good.
