We study a model of hard-core bosons with frustrated nearest-neighbor hopping
($t$) and repulsion ($V$) on the triangular lattice. We argue for a supersolid
ground state in the large repulsion ($V\gg|t|$) limit where a dimer
representation applies, by constructing a unitary mapping to the well
understood unfrustrated hopping case. This generalized 'Marshall sign rule'
allows us to establish the precise nature of the supersolid order by utilizing
a recently proposed dimer variational wavefunction, whose correlations can be
efficiently calculated using the Grassman approach. By continuity, a supersolid
is predicted over the wide parameter range, $V>-2t>0$. This also establishes a
simple phase diagram for the triangular lattice spin 1/2 XXZ antiferromagnet.
