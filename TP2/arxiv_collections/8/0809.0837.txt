Measurements of the pp-->ppK+K- reaction, performed with the experiment
COSY-11 at the Cooler Synchrotron COSY, show a significant difference between
the obtained excitation function and theoretical expectations including pp-FSI
>. The discrepancy may be assigned to the influence of K+K- or K-p interaction.
This interaction should manifest itself in the distributions of the
differential cross section. This thesis presents an analysis of event
distributions as a function of the invariant masses of two particle subsystems.
In particular in the analysis two generalizations of the Dalitz plot proposed
by Goldhaber and Nyborg are used. The present Investigations are based on the
experimental data determined by the COSY-11 collaboration from two measurements
at excess energies of Q = 10 MeV and 28 MeV. The experimental distributions are
compared to results of Monte Carlo simulations generated with various
parameters of the K+K- and K-p interaction. The values of the K+K- scattering
length, extracted from two data sets for Q = 10 MeV and 28 MeV amount to:
a_K+K- = (11 +- 8) + i(0 +- 6) fm for Q = 10 MeV, and a_K+K- = (0.2 +-0.2) +
i(0.0 +- 0.5) fm for Q = 28 MeV, Due to the low statistics, the extracted
values have large uncertainties and are consistent with very low values of the
real and imaginary part of the scattering length.
