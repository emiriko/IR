The critical behaviour of the O(n)-symmetric model with two n-vector fields
is studied within the field-theoretical renormalization group approach in a
D=4-2 epsilon expansion. Depending on the coupling constants the
beta-functions, fixed points and critical exponents are calculated up to the
one- and two-loop order, resp. (eta in two- and three-loop order). Continuous
lines of fixed points and O(n)*O(2) invariant discrete solutions were found.
Apart from already known fixed points two new ones were found. One agrees in
one-loop order with a known fixed point, but differs from it in two-loop order.
