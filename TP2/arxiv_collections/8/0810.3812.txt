A mixture of two fermionic species with different masses is studied in an
optical lattice. The heavy fermions are subject only to thermal fluctuations,
the light fermions also to quantum fluctuations. We derive the Ising-like
distribution for the heavy atoms and study the localization properties of the
light fermions numerically by a transfer-matrix method. In a two-dimensional
system one-parameter scaling of the localization length is found with a
transition from delocalized states at low temperatures to localized states at
high temperature. The critical exponent of the localization length is
$\nu\approx 0.88$.
