A Q-conic bundle germ is a proper morphism from a threefold with only
terminal singularities to the germ $(Z \ni o)$ of a normal surface such that
fibers are connected and the anti-canonical divisor is relatively ample.
Building upon our previous paper [math/0603736], we prove the existence of a Du
Val anti-canonical member under the assumption that the central fiber is
irreducible.
