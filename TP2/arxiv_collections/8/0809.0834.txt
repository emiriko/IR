Motivated by the recent experiments by the Westervelt group using a mobile
tip to probe the electronic state of quantum dots formed on a segmented
nanowire, we study the shifts in Coulomb blockade peak positions as a function
of the spatial variation of the tip potential, which can be termed "Coulomb
blockade microscopy". We show that if the tip can be brought sufficiently close
to the nanowire, one can distinguish a high density electronic liquid state
from a Wigner crystal state by microscopy with a weak tip potential. In the
opposite limit of a strongly negative tip potential, the potential depletes the
electronic density under it and divides the quantum wire into two partitions.
There the tip can push individual electrons from one partition to the other,
and the Coulomb blockade micrograph can clearly track such transitions. We show
that this phenomenon can be used to qualitatively estimate the relative
importance of the electron interaction compared to one particle potential and
kinetic energies. Finally, we propose that a weak tip Coulomb blockade
micrograph focusing on the transition between electron number N=0 and N=1
states may be used to experimentally map the one-particle potential landscape
produced by impurities and inhomogeneities.
