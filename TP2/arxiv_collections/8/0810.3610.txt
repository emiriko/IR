We report on potential for measurement of inclusive W and Z boson production
cross section using initial data from the LHC. We have designed W and Z
triggers, selection algorithms, and event reconstruction techniques for both
muon and electron decay modes, for low luminosity operation of the LHC
integrating up to about 10 pb-1. Initial calibrations and alignment accuracies
are assumed. While the accuracy of the cross section extracted will be
dominated by the integral luminosity measurement, ratios of W and Z production,
and asymmetry distributions will be important early measurements from LHC.
