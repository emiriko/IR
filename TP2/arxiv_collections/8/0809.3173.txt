Two parts of an entangled quantum state can have a correlation in their joint
behavior under measurements that is unexplainable by shared classical
information. Such correlations are called non-local and have proven to be an
interesting resource for information processing. Since non-local correlations
are more useful if they are stronger, it is natural to ask whether weak
non-locality can be amplified. We give an affirmative answer by presenting the
first protocol for distilling non-locality in the framework of generalized
non-signaling theories. Our protocol works for both quantum and non-quantum
correlations. This shows that in many contexts, the extent to which a single
instance of a correlation can violate a CHSH inequality is not a good measure
for the usefulness of non-locality. A more meaningful measure follows from our
results.
