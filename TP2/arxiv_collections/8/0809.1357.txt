We have performed a resonant x-ray scattering (RXS) study near the Co K edge
on a single crystal of Ca3Co2O6. In the magnetically ordered phase a new class
of weak reflections appears at the magnetic propagation vector tau
(1/3,1/3,1/3). These new reflections allow direct access to the
dipolar-quadrupolar E1E2 scattering channel. The theoretical possibility of
observing isolated E1E2 electromagnetic multipoles has attracted a lot of
interest in the recent years. Unfortunately in many system of interest, parity
even and parity odd tensor contributions occur at the same positions in
reciprocal space. We demonstrate that in Ca3Co2O6 it is possible to completely
separate the parity even from the parity odd terms. The possibility of
observing such terms even in globally centrosymmetric systems using RXS has
been investigated theoretically; Ca3Co2O6 allows a symmetry based separation of
this contribution.
