Rational points in the boundary of a hyperbolic curve over a field with
sufficiently nontrivial Kummer theory are the source for an abundance of
sections of the fundamental group exact sequence. We follow and refine
Nakamura's approach towards these boundary sections. For example, we obtain a
weak anabelian theorem for hyperbolic genus 0 curves over quite general fields
including for example the maximal abelian extension of the rational numbers.
