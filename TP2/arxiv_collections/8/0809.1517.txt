In this article we study a fully relativistic model of a two dimensional
hard-disk gas. This model avoids the general problems associated with
relativistic particle collisions and is therefore an ideal system to study
relativistic effects in statistical thermodynamics. We study this model using
molecular-dynamics simulation, concentrating on the velocity distribution
functions. We obtain results for $x$ and $y$ components of velocity in the rest
frame ($\Gamma$) as well as the moving frame ($\Gamma'$). Our results confirm
that J\"{u}ttner distribution is the correct generalization of
Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution. We obtain the same "temperature" parameter
$\beta$ for both frames consistent with a recent study of a limited
one-dimensional model. We also address the controversial topic of temperature
transformation. We show that while local thermal equilibrium holds in the
moving frame, relying on statistical methods such as distribution functions or
equipartition theorem are ultimately inconclusive in deciding on a correct
temperature transformation law (if any).
