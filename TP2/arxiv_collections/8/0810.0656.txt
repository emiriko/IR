In this paper we continue our investigation concerning the hyperbolic
geometry on the noncommutative ball $[B(H)^n]_1^-$, where $B(H)$ is the algebra
of all bounded linear operators on a Hilbert space $H$, and its implications to
noncommutative function theory. The central object is an intertwining operator
$L_{B,A}$ of the minimal isometric dilations of $A, B\in [B(H)^n]_1^-$, which
establishes a strong connection between noncommutative hyperbolic geometry on
$[B(H)^n]_1^-$ and multivariable dilation theory.
  The goal of this paper is to study the operator $L_{B,A}$ and its connections
to the hyperbolic metric $\delta$ on the Harnack parts of $[B(H)^n]_1^-$. We
study the geometric structure of the operator $L_{B,A}$ and obtain new
characterizations for the Harnack domination (resp. equivalence) in
$[B(H)^n]_1^-$. We express $\|L_{B,A}\|$ in terms of the reconstruction
operators $R_A$ and $R_B$, and obtain a Schwartz-Pick lemma for contractive
free holomorphic functions on $[B(H)^n]_1$ with respect to the intertwining
operator $L_{B,A}$. As a consequence, we deduce a Schwartz-Pick lemma for
operator-valued multipliers of the Drury-Arveson space, with respect to the
hyperbolic metric.
