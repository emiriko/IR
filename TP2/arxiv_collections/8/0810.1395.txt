Precise measurements of neutrino oscillation parameters and of
neutrino-nucleon cross-sections require a good understanding of neutrino beams:
flux as a function of energy, transverse beam profile, and flavour composition.
For this, hadron production spectra in proton-nucleus collisions are essential.
We report on double-differential inclusive large-angle cross-sections of the
production of secondary protons and charged pions, in the interactions with a
5% lambda thick stationary beryllium target, of proton and pion beams with
momentum from 3 GeV/c to 15 GeV/c. Our results show cross-sections reported by
the 'HARP Collaboration' to be wrong by factors of up to two.
