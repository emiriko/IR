We explore a mechanism of radiative B-L symmetry breaking in analogous to the
radiative electroweak symmetry breaking. The breaking scale of B-L symmetry is
related to the neutrino masses through the see-saw mechanism. Once we
incorporate the U(1)(B-L) gauge symmetry in SUSY models, the U(1)(B-L) gaugino
appears, and it can mediate the SUSY breaking (Z-prime mediated SUSY breaking)
at around the scale of 10^6 GeV. Then we find a links between the neutrino mass
(more precisly the see-saw or B-L scale of order 10^6 GeV) and the Z-prime
mediated SUSY breaking scale. It is also very interesting that the gluino at
the weak scale becomes relatively light, and almost compressed mass spectra for
the gaugino sector can be realized in this scenario, which is very interesting
in scope of the LHC.
