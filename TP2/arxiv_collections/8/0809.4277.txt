Coherent manipulation of an increasing number of qubits for the generation of
entangled states has been an important goal and benchmark in the emerging field
of quantum information science. The multiparticle entangled states serve as
physical resources for measurement-based quantum computing and high-precision
quantum metrology. However, their experimental preparation has proved extremely
challenging. To date, entangled states up to six, eight atoms, or six photonic
qubits have been demonstrated. Here, by exploiting both the photons'
polarization and momentum degrees of freedom, we report the creation of
hyper-entangled six-, eight-, and ten-qubit Schr\"odinger cat states. We
characterize the cat states by evaluating their fidelities and detecting the
presence of genuine multi-partite entanglement. Small modifications of the
experimental setup will allow the generation of various graph states up to ten
qubits. Our method provides a shortcut to expand the effective Hilbert space,
opening up interesting applications such as quantum-enhanced super-resolving
phase measurement, graph-state generation for anyonic simulation and
topological error correction, and novel tests of nonlocality with
hyper-entanglement.
