By a $B$-regular variety, we mean a smooth projective variety over $C$
admitting an algebraic action of the upper triangular Borel subgroup $B \subset
SL_2(C)$ such that the unipotent radical in $B$ has a unique fixed point. A
result of M. Brion and the first author describes the equivariant cohomology
algebra (over $C$) of a $B$-regular variety $X$ as the coordinate ring of a
remarkable affine curve in $X \times P^1$. The main result of this paper uses
this fact to classify the $B$-invariant subvarieties $Y$ of a $B$-regular
variety $X$ for which the restriction map $i_Y:H^*(X) \to H^*(Y)$ is
surjective.
