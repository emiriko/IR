New physics beyond the Standard Model could well preferentially show up at
the LHC in final states with taus. The development of efficient and accurate
reconstruction and identification of taus is therefore an important item in the
CMS physics programme. The potentially superior performance of a particle-flow
approach can help to achieve this goal with the CMS detector. Preliminary
strategies are presented in this summary for the hadronic decays of the taus.
