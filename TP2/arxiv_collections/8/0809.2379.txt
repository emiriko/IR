It is shown that the most important effects of special and general theory of
relativity can be understood in a simple and straightforward way. The system of
units in which the speed of light $c$ is the unit of velocity allows to cast
all formulas in a very simple form.The Pythagorean theorem graphically relates
energy, momentum and mass. The paper is addressed to those who teach and
popularize the theory of relativity.
