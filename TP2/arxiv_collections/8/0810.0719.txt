This work presents a new Microsoft Visual C# .NET code library, conceived as
a general object oriented solution for chaos analysis of three-dimensional,
relativistic many-body systems. In this context, we implemented the Lyapunov
exponent and the "fragmentation level" (defined using the graph theory and the
Shannon entropy). Inspired by existing studies on billiard nuclear models and
clusters of galaxies, we tried to apply the virial theorem for a simplified
many-body system composed by nucleons. A possible application of the "virial
coefficient" to the stability analysis of chaotic systems is also discussed.
