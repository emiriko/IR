We consider the possible contribution of Odderon (Reggeon with
\alpha_{Odd}(0) \sim 1 and negative signature) exchange to the differences in
the total cross sections of particle and antiparticle, to the ratios of
real/imaginary parts of the elastic pp amplitude, and to the differences in the
inclusive spectra of particle and antiparticle in the central region. The
experimental differences in total cross sections of particle and antiparticle
are compatible with the existence of the Odderon component but such a large
Odderon contribution seems to be inconsistent with the values of Re/Im ratios.
In the case of inclusive particle and antiparticle production the current
energies and/or accuracy of the experimental data don't allow a clear
conclusion.
