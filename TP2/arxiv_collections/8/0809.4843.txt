It is conjectured that Stark states of excited hydrogen atom posses magnetic
charge for which the quantum mechanical operator is $${\cal G}_{op} = {e\over
\hbar} (\vec\sigma\cdot\vec A)$$ where $\vec A$ is the Runge-Lenz vector. The
expectation value $g$ of this operator for Stark states is found to be $$ g =
e(n_1-n_2)$$ which obeys a Dirac-Saha type quantization formula $${eg\over c} =
(n_1-n_2)\alpha$$ where $\alpha$ is the fine structure constant and $n_1$ and
$n_2$ are parabolic quantum numbers. An experimental arrangement is outlined to
test this conjecture.
