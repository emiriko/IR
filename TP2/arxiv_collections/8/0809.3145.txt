In a one-component fluid, we investigate evaporation of a small axysymmetric
liquid droplet in the partial wetting condition on a heated wall at $T\sim 0.9
T_c$. In the dynamic van der Waals theory (Phys. Rev. E {\bf 75}, 036304
(2007)), we take into account the latent heat transport from liquid to gas upon
evaporation. Along the gas-liquid interface, the temperature is nearly equal to
the equilibrium coexisting temperature away from the substrate, but it rises
sharply to the wall temperature close to the substrate. On an isothermal
substrate, evaporation takes place mostly on a narrow interface region near the
contact line in a late stage, which is a characteristic feature in
one-component fluids.
