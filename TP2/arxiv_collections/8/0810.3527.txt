Astrophysical observations strongly suggest that non-luminous, nonbaryonic
components, so called "Dark Matter", may constitute most of the matter in the
Universe. The Cryogenic Dark Matter Search (CDMS) experiment is designed to
detect Dark Matter interaction events through nuclear recoils from elastic
scattering. The detector is capable of reading out both phonon and ionization
energy of an interaction in Ge or Si crystals. We present results from the CDMS
five-tower detector arrays. The data were collected in the period between
October 2006 and July 2007 (with an effective exposure of 121.3 kg-days). No
WIMP signal was observed. The results, when combined with previous CDMS Soudan
data, set a 90% confidence level upper bound on the WIMP-nucleon cross section
of $4.6\times 10^{-44}$ cm$^2$ at 60 Gev/c$^2$ WIMP mass.
