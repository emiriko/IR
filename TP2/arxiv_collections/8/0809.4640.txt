This article investigates the question of sensitivity of the solutions of
Smoluchowski equation on R_+^* with respect to parameters \lambda in the
interaction kernel K^lambda. It is proved that the solution is a C^1 function
of (t,lambda) with values in a good space of measures under the hypotheses
K^{lambda}(x,y) \leq phi(x)phi(y), for some sub-linear function phi, a
(4+epsilon)-moment assumption on the initial condition, and that the derivative
is a solution, in a suitable sense, of a linearized equation.
