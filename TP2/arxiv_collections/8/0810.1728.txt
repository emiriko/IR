We expand the IST transformation to three-dimensional Euclidean space and
derive the speed of light under the IST transformation. The switch from the
direction cosines observed in K to those observed in K-prime is surprisingly
smooth. The formulation thus derived maintains the property that the round trip
speed is constant. We further show that under the proper synchronization
convention of K-prime, the one-way speed of light becomes constant.
