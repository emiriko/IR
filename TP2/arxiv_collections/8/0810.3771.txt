We propose a definition of compact quantum groupoids in the setting of
C*-algebras, associate to such a quantum groupoid a regular
C*-pseudo-multiplicative unitary, and use this unitary to construct a dual Hopf
C*-bimodule and to pass to a measurable quantum groupoid in the sense of Enock
and Lesieur. Moreover, we discuss examples related to compact and to \'etale
groupoids and study principal compact C*-quantum groupoids.
