We consider N=2 supersymmetric extensions of the Camassa-Holm and
Hunter-Saxton equations. We show that they admit geometric interpretations as
Euler equations on the superconformal algebra of contact vector fields on the
1|2-dimensional supercircle. We use the bi-Hamiltonian formulation to derive
Lax pairs. Moreover, we present some simple examples of explicit solutions. As
a by-product of our analysis we obtain a description of the bounded
traveling-wave solutions for the two-component Hunter-Saxton equation.
