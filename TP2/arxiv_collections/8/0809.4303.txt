We construct exact vortex solutions in 3+1 dimensions to a theory which is an
extension, due to Gies, of the Skyrme-Faddeev model, and that is believed to
describe some aspects of the low energy limit of the pure SU(2) Yang-Mills
theory. Despite the efforts in the last decades those are the first exact
analytical solutions to be constructed for such type of theory. The exact
vortices appear in a very particular sector of the theory characterized by
special values of the coupling constants, and by a constraint that leads to an
infinite number of conserved charges. The theory is scale invariant in that
sector, and the solutions satisfy Bogomolny type equations. The energy of the
static vortex is proportional to its topological charge, and waves can travel
with the speed of light along them, adding to the energy a term proportional to
a U(1) Noether charge they create. We believe such vortices may play a role in
the strong coupling regime of the pure SU(2) Yang-Mills theory.
