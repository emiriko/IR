The field of spin electronics (spintronics) was initiated by the discovery of
giant magnetoresistance (GMR) for which Fert[1] and Grunberg[2] were awarded
the 2007 Nobel Prize for Physics. GMR arises from differential scattering of
the majority and minority spin electrons by a ferromagnet (FM) so that the
resistance when the FM layers separated by non-magnetic (NM) spacers are
aligned by an applied field is different to when they are antiparallel. In 1996
Slonczewski[3] and Berger[4] predicted that a large spin-polarised current
could transfer spin-angular momentum and so exert a spin transfer torque (STT)
sufficient to switch thin FM layers between stable magnetisation states[5] and,
for even higher current densities, drive continuous precession which emits
microwaves[6]. Thus, while GMR is a purely passive phenomenon which ultimately
depends on the intrinsic band structure of the FM, STT adds an active element
to spintronics by which the direction of the magnetisation may be manipulated.
Here we show that highly non-equilibrium spin injection can modify the
scattering asymmetry and, by extension, the intrinsic magnetism of a FM. This
phenomenon is completely different to STT and provides a third ingredient which
should further expand the range of opportunities for the application of
spintronics.
