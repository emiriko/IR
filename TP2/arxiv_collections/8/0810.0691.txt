We introduce a method to obtain the analytic solution of the higher-order
Baxter equation for twist-two and twist-three operators of planar N=4 SYM. Our
result proofs the conjectured formula for the three-loop anomalous dimension of
twist-two operators. As such we derive the maximally transcendental part of the
corresponding three-loop QCD result from the maximal supersymmetric gauge
theory in four dimension purely by methods of integrability.
