We show that the vacuum condensate due to particle mixing is responsible of a
dynamically evolving dark energy. In particular, we show that values of the
adiabatic index close to -1 for vacuum condensates of neutrinos and quarks
imply, at the present epoch, contributions to the vacuum energy compatible with
the estimated upper bound on the dark energy.
