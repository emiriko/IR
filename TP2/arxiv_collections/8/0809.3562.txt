Based on the principle of relativity and the postulate on universal invariant
constants ($c,l$) as well as Einstein's isotropy conditions, three kinds of
special relativity form a triple with a common Lorentz group as isotropy group
under full Umov-Weyl-Fock-Lorentz transformations among inertial motions.
