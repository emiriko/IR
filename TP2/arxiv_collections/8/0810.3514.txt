The universality and scaling behaviour of hadronisation have been
investigated in semi-inclusive neutral current deep inelastic ep scattering;
specifically the multiplicity and scaled momentum spectra of charged hadrons
have been measured and analysed. The measurements are performed in the current
region of the Breit frame, as well as in the current fragmentation region of
the hadronic centre-of-mass frame. The data collected at the HERA ep collider
by the H1 and ZEUS experiments are compared with similar measurements obtained
in e+e- annihilation and with previous ep measurements as well as with
leading-logarithm parton-shower predictions.
