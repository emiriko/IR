We study superconductivity in multilayer copper oxides, in the frame of a
realistic microscopic formulation. Solving the full temperature dependent BCS
gap equations, we obtain a maximum in the transition temperature Tc for M=3 or
4 CuO2 layers in the unit cell for appropriate values of the interlayer
tunneling (negative pair tunneling), and via the consideration of the doping
imbalance between the inner and outer layers. This is the ubiquitous
experimental result for Ca intercalated copper oxides, as opposed to other
intercalating elements. Further, using a restricted set of parameters, we
obtain an exact fit of Tc(M=1-4) for five different Ca intercalated homologuous
copper oxide families.
