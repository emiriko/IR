We investigate the undetermined sets consisting of two-level, multi-partite
pure quantum states, whose reduced density matrices give absolutely no
information of their original states. Two approached of finding these quantum
states are proposed. One is to establish the relation between codewords of the
stabilizer quantum error correction codes (SQECCs) and the undetermined states.
The other is to study the local complementation rules of the graph states. As
an application, the undetermined states can be exploited in the quantum secret
sharing scheme. The security is guaranteed by their undetermineness.
