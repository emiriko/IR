This paper discusses the effects of social learning in training of game
playing agents. The training of agents in a social context instead of a
self-play environment is investigated. Agents that use the reinforcement
learning algorithms are trained in social settings. This mimics the way in
which players of board games such as scrabble and chess mentor each other in
their clubs. A Round Robin tournament and a modified Swiss tournament setting
are used for the training. The agents trained using social settings are
compared to self play agents and results indicate that more robust agents
emerge from the social training setting. Higher state space games can benefit
from such settings as diverse set of agents will have multiple strategies that
increase the chances of obtaining more experienced players at the end of
training. The Social Learning trained agents exhibit better playing experience
than self play agents. The modified Swiss playing style spawns a larger number
of better playing agents as the population size increases.
