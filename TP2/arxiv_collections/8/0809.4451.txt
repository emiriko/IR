We study how a bias voltage changes magnetic exchange interactions. We derive
a general expression for magnetic exchange interactions for systems coupled to
reservoirs under a bias potential, and apply it to spin valves. We find that
for metallic systems, the interlayer exchange coupling shows a weak,
oscillatory dependence on the bias potential. For tunneling systems, we find a
quadratic dependence on the bias potential, and derive an approximate
expression for this bias dependence for a toy model. We give general conditions
for when the interlayer exchange coupling is a quadratic function of bias
potential.
