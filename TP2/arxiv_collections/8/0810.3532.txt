The construction of the non-logarithmic conformal field theory based on
sl^(2)_{-1/2} is revisited. Without resorting to free-field methods, the
determination of the spectrum and fusion rules is streamlined and the beta
gamma ghost system is carefully derived as the extended algebra generated by
the unique finite-order simple current. A brief discussion of modular
invariance is given and the Verlinde formula is explicitly verified.
