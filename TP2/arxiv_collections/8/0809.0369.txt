We study dynamical systems arising from word maps on simple groups. We
develop a geometric method based on the classical trace map for investigating
periodic points of such systems. These results lead to a new approach to the
search of Engel-like sequences of words in two variables which characterize
finite solvable groups. They also give rise to some new phenomena and concepts
in the arithmetic of dynamical systems.
