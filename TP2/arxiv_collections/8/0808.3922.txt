We present a study of the magnetic properties of Gd2/3Ca1/3MnO3 single
crystals at low temperatures. We show that this material behave as an
inhomogeneous ferrimagnet. In addition to small saturation magnetization at 5
K, we have found history dependent effects in the magnetization and the
presence of exchange bias. These features are compatible with microscopic phase
separation in the clean Gd2/3Ca1/3MnO3 system studied.
