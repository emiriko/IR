A new method is proposed to calculate wave functions in $k_T$-factorization
in \cite{LiMi} as a comment about our paper \cite{FMW}. We point out that the
results obtained with the method are in conflict with the translation
invariance and depend on the chosen contours for loop-integrals. Therefore, the
method is in principle unacceptable and the results with the method cannot be
correct.
