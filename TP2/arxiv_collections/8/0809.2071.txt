In ongoing electric pulse power driven inertial confinement fusion
experiments, Marx generators are connected in parallel with the target in the
center of a ring of the Marx generators. There the currents, not the voltages
add up. Instead of connecting a bank of Marx generator in parallel, one may
connect them in series, adding up their voltages, not the currents. If, for
example, fifty 20 MV Marx generators are connected in series, they would add up
to a gigavolt. But to prevent breakdown, the adding up of the voltages in such
a super-Marx generator must be fast. For this reason, it is proposed that each
of the Marx generators charges up a fast discharge capacitor, with the thusly
charged fast capacitors becoming the elements of a second stage super Marx
generator. In a super Marx generator, the Marx generators also assume the role
of the resistors in the original Marx circuit.
  With a voltage of 10^9 Volt and a discharge current of 10^7 Ampere, the
generation of a 10^16 Watt GeV proton beam becomes possible, which can ignite
in liquid deuterium a thermonuclear micro-detonation.
