Whereas bulk bismuth supports very-high mobility, light, Dirac electrons and
holes in its interior, its boundaries support a layer of heavy electrons in
surface states formed by spin orbit interaction in the presence of the surface
electric field. Small diameter d trigonal Bi nanowires (30 nm < d < 200 nm)
were studied via magnetotransport at low temperatures and for fields up to 14 T
in order to investigate the role of surfaces in electronic transport. A
two-dimensional behavior was expected for surface charges; however we found
instead a three-dimensional behavior, with a rich spectrum of Landau levels in
a nearly spherical Fermi surface. This is associated with the long penetration
length of surface states of trigonal wires. The prospect of the participation
of surface transport and surface-induced relaxation of bulk carriers in the
electronic properties of macroscopic samples is evaluated. We show that recent
observations of magnetoquantum peaks in the Nernst thermopower coefficient,
attributed to two-dimensional electron gas charge fractionalization, can be
more plausibly interpreted in terms of these surface states.
