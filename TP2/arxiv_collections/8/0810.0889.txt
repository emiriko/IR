We explore the correspondence between the final state in e^+e^- annihilation
and the small-x hadronic wavefunction in the transverse plane both in weakly
coupled QCD and strongly coupled N=4 SYM. At strong coupling, the virtual and
static photon produced in e^+e^- annihilation can be treated as a shock wave
propagating in AdS space leaving spherical energy and charge distributions on
the boundary. This is shown to be mathematically identical to the computation
of energy and charge distributions in the transverse plane generated by a high
energy color singlet state. At weak coupling, the correspondence is useful in
studying interjet observables. By performing the stereographic projection to
the BFKL equation, we construct an exact solution to the evolution equation
derived by Marchesini and Mueller, and find the angular distribution of small-x
gluons in the interjet region. Finally we argue that the correspondence holds
also for the energy correlation functions.
