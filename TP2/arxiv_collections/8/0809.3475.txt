We report electroluminescence (EL) measurements carried out on three-terminal
devices incorporating individual n-type CdSe nanowires. Simultaneous optical
and electrical measurements reveal that EL occurs near the contact between the
nanowire and a positively biased electrode or drain. The surface potential
profile, obtained by using Kelvin probe microscopy, shows an abrupt potential
drop near the position of the EL spot, while the band profile obtained from
scanning photocurrent microscopy indicates the existence of an n-type Schottky
barrier at the interface. These observations indicate that light emission
occurs through a hole leakage or an inelastic scattering induced by the rapid
potential drop at the nanowire-electrode interface.
