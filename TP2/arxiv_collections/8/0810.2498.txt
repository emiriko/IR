In the framework of coupled-channel formalism the relativistic four-quark
equations are found. The dynamical mixing of the meson-meson states with the
four-quark states is considered. The four-quark amplitudes of the tetraquarks
with open charm, including u, d, s, c quarks, are constructed. The poles of
these amplitudes determine the masses and widths of tetraquarks.
